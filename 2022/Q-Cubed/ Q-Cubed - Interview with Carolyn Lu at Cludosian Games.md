Hello everyone and welcome to yet another Indie Game Preservation Project interview. I am Jonas Rosland with Hit Save!. And I'm here today with Carolyn Lu from Cludosian Games. Hi, Carolyn. So we we met at Boston fig virtual fest a couple of weeks ago, almost a month ago now I think. And I saw your game Q-Cubed, or Q3 as I see you call it in some documents as well. And I was kind of amazed with the way it looked and the way the puzzles worked. So I wanted to interview you. And I've tried out the the demo as well. Not the demo, I paid for the game. It's only $2 on itch. I don't understand how you can sell it that cheap. But I tried the game. I had a blast with it. I'm stuck at level 42 shift right now. Trying to get past that. Yeah, so we want to talk about Q-Cubed. But I want to dive into who you are first. So, Carolyn, tell us a bit about yourself. Yeah, so

Carolyn Lu  1:35  
um, I guess my full time job is as a programmer. I think basically, I went into college like not really knowing what I want to do. I think originally I was like, physics or like, mechanical engineering, and then eventually kind of settled on computer science. Like, just the classes I took were the most fun. And I think so even before that, I was kind of interested in video games, but I was like, I don't really have the skill set for that, I guess. I think like, I was specifically interested in indie games, I guess, because I wasn't really like allowed to play video games much as a kid. And then I think in high school or something, I my friends started introducing me to like, indie games, basically. And I was like, wow, this is great. And like, and I was never that interested in shooters. So I always wanted to do that. And then during college, I guess like I kind of slowly moved myself to into like that space, I guess. Like, I think something that really appealed to me also is like I do art, I guess. Not super great. But I always really liked it. And so I think games really has this great intersection of, you know, the art side and the engineering side. So I ended up doing that. Basically, I think the thing that really like settled me in games was I worked on this project with some friends called recharge, which was a 2d platformer. And the idea was, it's here to move. So you have like a gun that you use to shoot enemies. But it also has a lot of recoil. And you basically use that to jump in platform. And yeah, so and I think it was 2018, we went to Boston fig. And we won the student category. So that was super cool. And then we applied to the student category for the Game Awards. And we got nominated. So we got to, like fly over to LA and like, watch the game awards. Didn't win that, but it was super cool. So after that, I was like, Okay, I got to get into real like, it's just very fun, I think working on it. And like seeing that tension, I guess, like from other people was very rewarding. And yeah, so I ended up working at harmonics. In Boston for a couple years, I worked on fuser, which is this DJing game, and I was on r&d for maybe half a year. And then I am currently at unknown worlds working on a unannounced project.

Jonas Rosland  4:10  
Awesome, awesome and unknown worlds. What what are they known for? I think

Carolyn Lu  4:15  
their most well known game series is Subnautica. Awesome. I personally have not worked on

Jonas Rosland  4:24  
so yeah, you haven't worked on Subnautica at all yet? Nope. Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah, I've tried Subnautica is really hard. It I am not good at survival games. Yeah, it's gorgeous. I was playing it the other week. It's it's super fun. But I need something a little easier. I can't I can't be looking at for myself and feed myself all the time. I do that a real life and when I'm when I'm playing a game I want something more relaxed. So,

Carolyn Lu  5:00  
yeah, I'm always like, I really want to explore here and then I just run out of oxygen.

Jonas Rosland  5:06  
Exactly, exactly. Yeah. And so you worked at harmonics, and now you're at Subnautica. But as a side project, you've been doing this. Cute, cute. So tell us a bit about the game.

Carolyn Lu  5:24  
Yeah, so I started this kind of, I think 2019 Finished. I'd worked on it actually in class A couple years before that, but didn't take it very far. And so the concept originally was the prompting class was a symmetric Co Op. So you know, Co Op, where the two different players are presented with different information in different controls. So taking that pretty, literally, it was like, Okay, what if the players just see from two different perspectives, they see the same scene, but they're controlling two different axes and seeing it from two different perspectives. So originally, cube was a cough game, but it turned out it's like, what would usually happen is one player would just tell the other player what to do. So it kind of made more sense as a single player game. And you control the two sides of the screen using SD and arrow keys. So the game is kind of about using those two perspectives that you see to figure out what the 3d scene that you're looking at, looks like, and then figuring out how to navigate through that seem to reach the goal.

Jonas Rosland  6:31  
Awesome. And the the trailer that I was looking at, at the Boston fake virtual fest there. It kind of broke my brain a bit. Because I didn't really understand how I was supposed to figure out the solution here, because as you said, it looks like a co op game, because you're having these two, two planes of view. And we'll we'll dive into a few screenshots here in a bit. But as I was playing it, I was like, Yeah, okay, I get it. But I have to think in multiple dimensions at the same time, and from several different from two different viewpoints. And as I was playing the game, yes, it absolutely broke my brain multiple times. I felt like I don't understand how this is going to work. And then of course, I found the solution for many of them, I still have not found a solution for level 42. Looking forward to trying that out. Maybe tonight. But yeah, it's it's really, really cool. The way you control your little character, does it? Does your character have a name?

Carolyn Lu  7:41  
No, I guess it's just a cube. I think in my scenes, it's named cube character.

Jonas Rosland  7:49  
Awesome. So the little cube that you move around, and let's, let's dive into some of the artwork here. So people can see what we're talking about as well. So when you're when you're looking at the screen, here, you're presented with these two different views, and you have to move around, I was using your controller, and it was super, super slick to use a controller I thought. So that was super, super nice to see that I didn't have to use a keyboard. But I could use a controller as well. So twin stick. And yeah, I just had a blast playing through it, and trying to figure out the puzzles here. So how did you come up with these puzzles? So first of all, how do you create something like this? Because you, you have to think about what it would look like and how it would work from a different point of view than the other two you're showing? Right? Yeah,

Carolyn Lu  8:46  
I mean, so I think my normal workflow is, you know, Unity has the, kind of like the editor viewpoint, which is like, you see everything in 3d and, and they like the game viewpoint. So I always have to work with both of them open. So like, here, yeah, this is an image of like, what I'm looking at, I guess, in a 3d scene, but it's hard to know how that translates into 2d. So I have this other camera view, right, with the two different perspectives that are split screen. So a lot of it is just like, you know, I know what it looks like in 3d, but I need to make sure it translates in 2d, because it's very easy to make a 3d scene that doesn't that isn't really like deducible from 2d. So some of the things you might have noticed is like, I'll usually make sure things are at different heights. So you can always make that connection between the two objects there because they share that axis right. So you know, if something is this height, and this side, then it's also that had the side that means it's like the same object. Yeah, so I think, you know, making the first few levels it's really about trying to reinforce that concept. About like, you know, first it starts with just it's the same goal like you're gonna reach this One White Ball. But it's, you know, even though it's looks like it's on different places on both screens, it actually is the same ball and you need to get both of your both of your characters lined up with it in order to actually hit it. And then moving on from that it's like, okay, so now you have this cube, which is the same, but maybe it's longer in this dimension than the other one. And then you have like, a staircase or something. And it's like, okay, like, you need to jump on that step of the staircase at the same time in both dimensions, which, you know, sounds complicated, but it's really you just walk up to it in one dimension and make sure you're lined up in the other chatbot to it. But it's kind of just trying to slowly introduce those concepts, and then later just kind of add adding some of the typical platforming challenges, but it becomes much more complicated. When you're playing it in this, like, two dimensional three dimensional view.

Jonas Rosland  10:58  
Yeah, the, as you advance, especially the little springy mechanic that you have the jump mechanic, that threw me for a loop for a few times as long as like, Okay, should I jump here? Or should I wait? Or where am I going? I'm not really sure. Oh, I'm looking forward to lasers. That'll be fun. The Yeah, the the puzzles are really well thought out, I thought in the end, the start up the game really eases you into how you should think about the game. There's no, that there's very little explanation. And you're kind of like putting the player immediately, like here, just play this. And here's how you just control it. It's kind of like, the first Megaman were just thrown in, you have no idea what to do. And all of a sudden, you have to learn and adjust and understand how the game works to be able to play it. So no tutorial really, outside of the first couple of few levels to get the east into it. But I really liked it. It's it's really, really neat. So the the cube character. What's the what's the genesis of this? You said it was a project that you worked on? For a bit in 2019? So how did you come up with it? Yeah, I

Carolyn Lu  12:30  
think I mentioned it briefly. But it was basically I had a class event like a couple of years before that, it might have been 2017, where the prompt was asymmetric gameplay. So there's this kind of like asymmetric pop experience. And I worked on it a little bit with a few other people. But we didn't like take the concept super far. And then kind of in 2019. After finishing up recharge, I really wanted to come back to the idea basically and like, flush it out.

Jonas Rosland  12:59  
So you're the sole developer behind this game. Yeah, yeah. So you've done everything from art to programming to music. Yeah. So you said you were interested in art? How did you get into? Well, everything else to become a game developer? You talked a bit about it, but how did you go from focusing on art more to becoming a game developer? Yeah, I

Carolyn Lu  13:30  
mean, so I started working, like I started learning computer science, mostly in college. And that was very, like, interesting to me, I thought, like, the class is really fun. So I was pretty interested in kind of, you know, the part of computer science that has some relationship to art. So like graphics, just like generative art, being able to like have that like so I think that part of me is like, I really enjoy kind of technical logical thinking, but I really enjoy more subjective aesthetic results. So that's kind of what I'm drawn to. And then music wise, I like kind of have been involved in music since I was a kid. You know, the piano and then I was in chorus and like an acapella group in college. So that was always something I wanted to kind of use a little bit of, I wouldn't say I'm a great composer, but it's fun to be able to make these kind of simple things for the game. And you know, I use GarageBand for not only the soundtrack, but all of the sound effects. I just kind of little instruments.

Jonas Rosland  14:42  
I'm super jealous of people like you have multiple talents like that. It's just so cool to see. I can barely draw stick figures. And I can do a bit of programming but nothing like this. So this is really cool to see.

Carolyn Lu  14:57  
I mean, I'm sure you'd be able to do a cube cube and So pretty much all very simple primitives.

Jonas Rosland  15:03  
Maybe you can teach me because I have no idea where to start. So with the with the puzzles as the as they progress, how many levels are there in the game in total right now? I

Carolyn Lu  15:18  
think there's 54 right now.

Jonas Rosland  15:22  
So, as you progress, how do you how do you come up with new ideas for levels?

Carolyn Lu  15:28  
Yeah, so I think each kind of there's, I separate it into different looking environments. So you know, we've been seeing like, this is kind of like a cherry blossom themed one, there's like the desert, there's like under the sea. But each of them kind of revolves around a different new mechanic. So this is the kind of starter area, it's just trying to learn it. The second one is about moving blocks. So it's kind of that's when you have to think about like, it's moving in one dimension, but not the other. And what what that looks like. The third one's kind of about like doors and like, getting going through walls. Fourth one, I think is like this rocket, like ramp kind of beam. Yeah, so it's kind of like coming up with one new mechanic, and then trying to explore that fully, and kind of teach you how that works before moving on to the next one.

Jonas Rosland  16:24  
Like it. Do you have? Do you have plans for more than 54? Levels? Ah,

Carolyn Lu  16:33  
yeah, I guess I originally wanted to, like, do I don't know, maybe it was too ambitious, like 100 levels. But I think, basically, when I started working on this in 2019, right, but that was before I started working full time. So I kind of like dropped off on working on it so much. So at this point, I was like, I'm just gonna get something like out there and finished. But I do think I'm like, kind of open to working on it more in the future if I come up with new ideas.

Jonas Rosland  17:03  
Awesome. And yeah, so you sent over some level planning documents as well. So the existing ones and you talked about them? Cherry Blossom, for instance, winter cave, underwater. The rain and grass and Twilight, then, yeah, the planned ones were factory, maybe a beach level. Jungle, and sky and a TV, black and white, which is super interesting, too.

Carolyn Lu  17:37  
Yeah, I think the the laser kind of level ended up being a combination of like factory and like UV, I guess, like more technologically exams. And like, I think most of the other levels are very, like nature adjacent, I guess.

Jonas Rosland  17:52  
It's a very chill game. But you're still you still need to have full control over your character to move at certain times. It's not just a puzzle that you can solve by by just moving things around. But you actually have to wait for that as well. Yeah, exactly. So it's, it has this this great vibe. I really liked the music, the aesthetic, it's super chill, but it also very frustrating at the same time, and super, super fun. So I really like it. I want to show the old levels of it. And did you show this at other fig? Boston fig first or anything else? Or demos or something like that?

Carolyn Lu  18:42  
Not really, that was kind of just how the game started. So I had fun friends play I basically. Yeah, we can take a look and I can talk a bit more about it.

Jonas Rosland  18:52  
Okay, let's do that. So, let's dive into the, again, the genesis of the game and kind of how it gets started. We have a few old levels that we can look at here. So tell me a bit about how this all got started and how it went from this to what we're seeing today.

Carolyn Lu  19:15  
Yeah, so I think a lot of the old levels are very similar like mechanically to the later level so like, you'll recognize this as like the forest bounce level, I think it's maybe like the second one in that environment. So a lot of the mechanics or like a lot of the like general design of the level is like pretty much the same. So it was kind of this whole process of just like figuring out how to communicate these rules and putting them into place but I think when I started it I was very kind of attached to this idea of everything needs to be super minimalist like there's no distractions and like I think another thing they will notice is like the colors are very bright. And I tried to kind of keep it so that all of the different types of blocks are a different color. And then they stay the same color and all the different environments. So even though the background changes, the block is in color, because I was worried, like people, you know, would maybe have a hard time distinguishing between the different types of blocks. So like, the base block is always right, no matter the environment. And then like this whole block is always pink, and then moving blocks are always blue. So it wasn't very aesthetically pleasing. But I was trying to kind of keep it very straightforward. And then I think eventually, like one of my friends was like, like, doesn't look great. Like, would it be okay, if you like, changed the color scheme a bit? And I was like, oh, okay, like, I'm just like, worried that other people wouldn't be able to, you know, understand how they transferred over and different environments. But after trying it for a few different environments, I was like, oh, no, this totally works. So I think that's like the biggest change that you can see between the old levels and the new one is like, you know, there's a gradient background. And they all have like a very explicit connection to some type of nature scene. And I think that makes for a much better experience, I guess. Even though you're frustrated, hopefully, the environment is a little bit calming.

Jonas Rosland  21:19  
The frustration comes from the the puzzles that I that I don't understand how to solve, not frustrated at the game. I'm just frustrated myself not being able to solve the puzzle. So now I was having a blast playing this the other night. It was really nice. And yeah, just super chill, as well. So you tell me a bit about how you get started with your game studio Colossian games, and and self publishing as well. What are your thoughts about that? And how did you? How did you plan that?

Carolyn Lu  21:58  
Yeah, I think I'm still very new to all of this. So this is like my first kind of independent project. And also the first time I've even tried to monetize anything a bit. So currently, it's only on edge, just because that's definitely, I think, the most easiest platform for indie developers to get on. So that's definitely my if it's my first time doing it, but I am looking to get it on Steam eventually, kind of like navigate that process. But I would say I'm still very new

Jonas Rosland  22:30  
to all of this. So how does that work? How do you how do you publish something on it? I have no idea how that works. Yeah,

Carolyn Lu  22:40  
it's pretty straightforward. So if you create a new project, they kind of give you this page to fill out. So like, you know, you add your logo, your titles, and then it's very nice that you can upload different files. And then you can also set a price for those files. So you know, you can say that this is like the PC one, this is the Mac one. And then you can set a general price for any of the downloads. And then another convenient features, they also let you have a demo on the same one. So you can like check off like this build is a demo build. So don't charge for this one. And you can upload screenshots and trailers. So I'd say it's very, very user friendly. And they kind of just set up the whole page for you.

Jonas Rosland  23:27  
That's awesome. So pretty, pretty easy to get started. That sounds great. And definitely what's needed for indies. So this is really cool. So you said you might be looking at Steam as well. Yeah.

Carolyn Lu  23:44  
Figure out that process. I haven't gone that far. But

Jonas Rosland  23:47  
are you looking at any other platforms as well? Um, I haven't been

Carolyn Lu  23:53  
actively considering it. But I think something early on that like people have said is like, maybe this could be a mobile game. I'd have to rethink the controls there but depending on how much more work I want to put into this, maybe I would give that a try.

Jonas Rosland  24:11  
Yeah, I was thinking this. This definitely fits. So I was playing it with a a regular controller so twin stick setup. And I was thinking this would also be a really good switch game. I think. So have you had any thoughts about that?

Carolyn Lu  24:28  
I haven't looked into that at all.

Jonas Rosland  24:31  
I have no idea of what what that would entail but you're creating it in Unity. So hopefully it would be fairly easy to port something over to it. Because I think the the whole game the way it looks and the way it controls I think it would definitely fit really well into a handheld and right now of course the the the switch is the biggest seller for that. And if you were on Steam, then the steam deck of course would be a really nice handheld for it as well. So this is this really cool. You're monetizing it right now it's only two bucks. Again, I don't understand how you can only take two bucks for this, I was super happy to throw that money up on edge there. So what were you? What are you thinking? What are you waiting to look at monetizing your your product like this? What goes through your head? Yeah, I mean,

Carolyn Lu  25:31  
I think part of it was, as I was asking my friends, like, how much did you pay for this? Especially like coming in, like, you know, imagine you don't know me, and you don't know that much about the game. So that's part of it. Also, kind of looking at the amount of play time. So like, obviously, it depends on how fast you're getting through this. But I think on average, it's like between one and two hours or something. Compared to the now there's much larger games. So kind of the idea of that. And like, also, I just want it to be accessible enough of a price point, like I think to me right now. It's not really my main income. So I think one of my big goals is just to have more people play my game. So keeping it more accessible, I guess is like, something that I'm trying to do.

Jonas Rosland  26:18  
Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Yeah, as I said, Two bucks. Easy buy? Absolutely. And, yeah, it got me playing it. I really like it. So I'm happy to share it with others as well. And I hope they will be happy to pay for it as well. So what do you what are you planning for the game? You said you had this big goal of maybe 100 levels? Where do you see the game and say, six months? Yeah, I mean, I think

Carolyn Lu  26:53  
it really depends on how I'm feeling. I think, you know, in the past few months, I kind of flushed out the laser levels, like that was the biggest new environment. So, you know, I had some of the other ideas that you mentioned, like from the sign docs. But I think for me, like my approach to this project has always been pretty much like, I work on what I want. So like, you know, my design docs are very scattered, because I think since it's just myself, I kind of write down my ideas. But in the end, I kind of want to keep it like, I'm only working on what I want to work on. So like, part of it is like I am a programmer at work, right. So I keep the programming in this game, very light. Everything is pretty simple. It's like just a character moving around. And I am kind of leaning a lot more into like the aesthetic senses. Like music and just like the general look of the game, like I think that's like pretty fun for me to work on. So I kind of keep I'm kind of open to working on more stuff. But I also don't really want to force myself to work on the parts that I don't enjoy. Because I think the goal for me with this game is ultimately just to build something that I want, not necessarily to make a ton of money or like do something very complicated. Yeah, so I think I'm definitely open to adding more things, but at the same time, I'm not going to force myself.

Jonas Rosland  28:35  
Okay, I think that's fine. For sure. You don't want to get burnt out on stuff you don't want to do. For sure.

Carolyn Lu  28:42  
Yeah. Yeah, it's it's, I think, sometimes hard just like working in games full time, but also as your side projects.

Jonas Rosland  28:49  
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So speaking of the the indie game and indie game community, um, what are you? Are you a part of any indie game communities around here, around here in Boston or online or something else? I would say

Carolyn Lu  29:11  
like the most interaction I get, I guess it's like Boston fig. I have attended Boston game loop in the past. And like, I think I obviously, like know, some people from working out harmonics, but I am not really as involved as I'd want to be. And I think, you know, part of it was I started wanting to be more involved kind of right before the pandemic started. So I've kind of been waiting for the in person events to start back up so I can get more involved because I really like every time I talk to people, you know, around here who are working under r&d projects. It's like super rewarding and super fun because I think everyone has all these different perspectives and are working on really cool projects and it's, you know, cool to be able to talk to them in person. So definitely something I want to do more of

Jonas Rosland  30:00  
I'm also looking forward to, in person events a lot here, we, we started, hit save, right, as the pandemic started as well. And it's definitely something that we want to do we want to go out and meet people and go to conferences and cool events and indie game meetups and things like that. So yeah, we're, we're definitely looking forward to that, too. So, speaking of indie gaming, and indie games in general, what are you most excited about for the future of indie games? Yeah, I think,

Carolyn Lu  30:36  
I mean, definitely, the appeal of indie games, for me is the one that they're often more creative. They I think, you know, since it's a smaller team, it's a it's easier to take risks, I guess. And then I think another thing that really appeals to me is just like, since usually there's fewer people working on it, I think each individual's contribution is much more easily felt by the player. Like, you can kind of see their vision for the game. You know, whether they're the artists or the programmer, like, writer, I think it comes across like a lot more personal, when it's, you know, just one or two people working on some part of the game. Yeah, so I think like, for me, like, I don't play a ton of triple A game. So like, I think it's been really cool to just see the indie space, like evolve. I think nowadays, there's indie games with a lot more polish. And like, obviously, there's, you know, kind of bigger publishers of indie games nowadays. So that's been kind of interesting. But like, hopefully that means that like, the small teams are able to get more funding and like, bring together really good teams to, like, have enough time to work on the product that they want. So I'm hoping that it will kind of continue in that direction, where, you know, we're just seeing more and more people kind of get that the financial support they need to work on bigger projects and like risky new things that we wouldn't really see as much in these like, huge budget AAA games.

Jonas Rosland  32:17  
All right, this has been awesome. Carolyn, thank you so much for being a part of the interview here. Where can people find out more about the game about you and what you're up to?

Carolyn Lu  32:29  
Yeah, so I'm Cludosian on most platforms so you can find me on Twitter at Cludosian and I also have Cludosian_Games that is more focused on my games, so mostly Q-Cubed and then Q-Cubed is currently on itch.io avail there's a demo with 20 Something levels and then the full games or the 54 levels that are out now it's available for $2 and hopefully and maybe a few months it'll be on Steam Yeah, and I hope to be posting a little bit more on my Twitter's you can follow my progress there. Awesome.

Jonas Rosland  33:09  
Awesome. Yeah, definitely go check out Q-Cubed. I've been having a blast playing through it. It's absolutely worth $2 So please go by it and support Carolyn here and give her feedback. This has been wonderful. Thank you so much, Carolyn. I'm Jonas Roslin here with hit Save!. This has been an interview for the Indie Game Preservation Project. Have an awesome rest of the week, everyone. Thanks for listening
