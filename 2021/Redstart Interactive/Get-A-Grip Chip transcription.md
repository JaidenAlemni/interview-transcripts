Jonas Rosland  
Hi everyone and welcome to another fantastic interview with indie game developers here at hit save. This is part of our Indie Game Preservation Project, and today I'm joined by John Lowe wits and Vicky way from redstart interactive and. Hello, and I also have with me, rich McGrath from, say hello. So we're going to talk about, Get a grip, Chip, a really fun platformer that launched on switch yesterday. So we're gonna dive into the Switch launch a bit, but I want to start out with you all. Who are you, who is John and Vicki.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, so I guess I'll go first. So I'm John. And we're both directors at Redstart. And yeah, I was involved with the program on Get-A-Grip Chip, a bit on the design. And, yeah, we're a pretty small team so I hit on a lot of different things, but yeah primarily programming and design.

Vicky Wei  
Hey everyone, I'm Vicky, and I currently handle the game design for Get-A-Grip Chip and planning.

Jonas Rosland  
Awesome, awesome. So, how did you get started in game development, how did you how did you get to this space.

Vicky Wei  
Well, I think we worked in prior industries but then a lot of them felt that teams and that is the gamification actually training works, and a lot of UX, UI work. We just started, we started with, Get-A-Grip Chip actually, this was our first foray into games, so trying to finish that first game.

Jon Lawitts  
We just sort of dove in, really. But yeah, we were both personally working for larger companies, web development, UX, UI that sort of thing and we thought that this would be way more interesting and, you know, more of a challenge and, yeah, I think there was a lot of appeal in the challenge of making games and starting a business.

Vicky Wei  
It's very cohesive, there's so many industries involved. Programming, design is its own, art and animation and sound. Sound, music and then UX, UI course and marketing as well.

Jonas Rosland  
Yeah, there are a lot of moving pieces to this, it's not just programming and putting some nice sprites together.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah. Yes, I think there was some appeal and trying to tackle a fairly complex project. Yeah. So

Rich McGrath  
Was it a you quit your jobs and let's start developing a game, or were you working your nine to five, coming home and like bootstrapping it. So what was that process like and when did you decide to make that decision to like okay, we don't need the nine to five anymore.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah. So, initially we were, you know, working at night or on weekends that sort of thing. And yeah, so, you know, eventually we made a decision like Well, I think we'd be able to do a much better job of this full time. And, yeah, we just made the leap to do it. I know, common wisdom is, You probably shouldn't do that, but we were sort of in a good place we had gotten our enough runway in front of us to be able to take some time to think about running a business. The product itself. Yeah,

Vicky Wei  
the decision was Apple two honestly like many great startup business things was definitely one of those businesses. So we took paths.

Jonas Rosland  
So, when did you when did you start the development here on Get a grip chip. 

Vicky Wei
January 2020.

Jonas Rosland  
Oh, really. Yeah, yeah. That's quick.

Jon Lawitts  
So yeah, the whole production. It's maybe a little gray. Yeah, exactly, exactly it's but the whole production was about nine months, obviously you're still working on things for it so we're counting but we had a couple of rounds, we've been working on for that. And ultimately we decided that we wanted to move forward with this one. And so yeah, once we made. January. So an interesting time to be starting a project. Yeah. Monster so,

Vicky Wei  
then obviously for the Switch launch that took about, I think this Switch launch took about two months to get it.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, yeah, there's sort of a lot of unknowns around that we started carrying it over. But I was pretty happy with two months for us to get that on board and over considering it's our first time doing that sort of thing.

Jonas Rosland  
Did you port it yourself or did you hire some outside help. Yeah, we did a, we did, we did content. Oh, wow, that's really impressive.

Rich McGrath  
How does that process work ordering something to, like, did you have to go get it. I remember councils in the past, you'd had to get a dev kit to be able to write to it is that similar to what the switch and how'd you get Nintendo to be on board with it and say yes we want the game on because I've known the DS days that they were a little bit more protective of what could get on the platform.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, I think they are still relatively protective. And there are processes kind of somewhat unknown exactly how they determine what is going to go on the platform or not, but for us, we, you know, we had a good portion of the game running when we started to reach out to them. So we had a good example of what the final product is going to be. And I think we had a pretty strong pitch, we put together, but essentially we, you know they've got an online portal where you can fill out a form and then cross your fingers. I think unless you know someone there already. That was, that was the process that we went through, it's just our pitch, make it as good as you possibly can.

Vicky Wei  
I think we apply them to their inbox. So we knew after about one year after this launch. We decided to go actually did we decide to go ahead and switch on being our watch, so that it was better for us.

Jon Lawitts  
But yeah, when you, when we. It was exhilarating to get the email that says that you're accepted into the developer program. A lot of their, a lot of their material and stuff is sort of locked down and they watch it too much. But yeah, we're going to get the emails, it was great to see and we start poring through all the documentation and figuring out how to get the best. There's almost like a research phase. After getting accepted we have to figure out how all this works.

Jonas Rosland  
So, you get the dev kit, and then you have to figure out all the the documentation, how to actually get your game on to the console and how to try to rework the game to work on this fancy handheld.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, yeah, we had somewhat of a leg up maybe on that front, you know, we had already supported controllers. We tried to support as many other consultants we possibly could actually did, you know, I guess you could use a switch controller on your PC if you want to. So some of that who we have working already, I think the biggest part is probably about the leaderboards and other fun. Before this, which is a pretty small device. Yeah, we were hooked into the team leaderboards, had to be turned over. And we also

worked on the code so yeah there was initially there was a couple of areas that we just got away with it being a little less performance than it could be because of, you know, it was running on desktop, where we could assume reasonably that people could run.

Remember in particular there was some of our particle systems were just a little too heavy for Twitch and so we ended up reworking, how they work. Ultimately I think visually they didn't end up looking all that different. There's just a couple of settings here and there and some of our code to make them work more efficiently.

Vicky Wei  
On the levels to it so when you log on. Originally, Every single thing at once. Oh, first this switch, we went through this actually made. And we put like sequences on triggers so that they will only start moving. So, basically you can, you can actually like run pretty fast, because it's actually, yeah it is responsive but it's actually nice as well.

Jonas Rosland  
I noticed that as I was playing through the first couple of levels that it seems like it's really built out for speed runs as well. Someone could get really proficient at this I am not, absolutely not. But I can, I can see someone else, be very, very good at this and speed running the game was that something that you had in the back of your minds when building the, the, the level so

Vicky Wei  
yeah actually like several things were like in line. It was like both the both the Steve on the inside players get competitive to the authorities. But you can do it by players that involve finding secrets, it's like, it's like almost like puzzle elephants, and also for players who just played play, have a good time and not do either. So there's like, like multiple elements. But if you want to take your time search, or just kind of Mexico.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, so we tried to design the level so that you could pick your own path through it if you want to get time fast. There's there's some areas in particular where, yeah, there's, there's no, there's a little side route, you can go get an extra collectible, or even if there isn't an extra Collectibles this one route is maybe a little faster but more difficult, versus the safe and slow path for

Rich McGrath  
famously in the original Mario Brothers, they kept the bushes in the clouds the same and just change the color, or just save on memory, was there any like little tricks you had to do like that when porting it over I know you had talked about particles or anything like he had to do that to get it on the switch, actually did start to think a lot of it. And actually, there's these concrete blocks that change.

Jon Lawitts  
Cool barrels as well. Yeah, we had a handful of props, we thought would be appropriate in any stage of the game. And so yeah we did just a simple sort of color swap, so that we can get a nice variety but still have a lot of skill filled out. I think a lot of that was really just, when it comes to sort of time and efficiency of making things, maybe a little less, I think, you know, I think for 2d game. Being able to store all the textures. Like it wasn't too much of an issue but if you didn't do a ton of optimization as well that's the most part of working. All right. Yeah, just in terms of, there were a very small team, in terms of creating the actual I looked for ways to create the variety without having to design. 100 new objects every time I got a new idea.

Rich McGrath  
Nice to know those tricks from like the early 80s are still in games being made today, what would you say like third a game or someone a programmer that influenced your, your, your style and your creativity in terms of interactive entertainment.

Jon Lawitts  
I think Nintendo is probably the third one I mean I don't know if that's even if you could escape there. But I think one of the big parts that we tried to focus on in terms of the design and influence of it is, I think they've done a really good job of making their games accessible. They have a huge audience and look anyone can pick up on their games and have a good time. And so I think that a big part of what we've tried to achieve, both in this game and just in the company. You're trying to make things that are accessible that anybody can try that are not so punishingly difficult but only like your Dark Souls players and get interested in it. I think that was a big part of it because, yeah, we're in terms of design of this game. We're looking to focus on essentially a single mechanic. Get familiar with quickly, and then, you know, it had enough depth to it that it took a while to really master if you want to be more of a speed runner. That's our fire was probably.

Vicky Wei  
Also, some of our first, but I only Commando, as a reference, as well. And

Jon Lawitts  
just baffling. We have sort of a similar behavior, grappling with as much different ways that you might be able to do a grappling swing or take an approach more like we did which is grapple towards a point and you go straight towards it. And I think we tried to go a step further than that, There's this moment that you can kind of leap off of the attach point.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, and they actually act. In the end it's actually like a platformer just like a jump, we launch off the bolts. It is like very similar.

Rich McGrath  
I noticed that when playing for the first time when he got on and then you hold it like you could do a little jumping it completely opened up the levels for me, and how to get through some of the points I was like, oh I get it now. Okay cool, because I was having so much trouble going over like what's going on and then was that I was like, Oh, I guess. Yeah, same for me. When I got with the design, how are you teaching. And how are you teaching players to learn those mechanics in game like what does that like and then trying to see how players interact with it and trying to figure out, how come they don't get this. How can we make them understand it, it's almost like this weird in between, uh, trying to communicate. Oh, we did. I

Vicky Wei  
think we change the tutorial, one. And because just like just constantly, when people realize that there's something that the way that you vote for that, I think, oh it was too much. Once we needed. Even the players for what they had just opened up the tutorial a little bit more.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah we. Yeah, it was like a week, a week before launch, we, we made some changes to it, I think, I think the realization, personally, was that, At that stage we were doing a decent job. But yeah, there wasn't enough time for the player to actually sort of explore each aspect of it before we moved on to the next, we added these segments that were just using the same part of the mechanic. Over and over, and it didn't introduce something new for, you know, an extra room. And so that was the right choice. It allowed the player to play with it. For we throw a new concept at them, like,

Vicky Wei  
yeah like that element of exploration, even though it's like a really good exploration tool so you can just walk around

Jon Lawitts  
in a safe space. But yeah, teaching the player isn't much a point of iteration in our play testers tutorial, or even just when we were initially, designing, Chip. We went through a ton of iteration on on like the millisecond by millisecond month you know movements of the hook and how long it takes to, from, you know, the way you connect to when chip is at the anchor point. And, you know every little tiny number in that sort of equation. Yeah, it's like, it's fine. Can I tell it felt right. Yeah, definitely has a really good feel to it, the speed and the how the gravity behaves and everything, it just feels right for the character. So yeah, I would imagine that would have taken a lot of testing and a lot of iterations to get just right, similar to what you see in brawlers, as well. Getting the punches, just right. Yeah, I think it was definitely a process. I think we were sort of surprised at the difference that a very small change would make one of the ones that I remember, freaking a bunch was just being right so, you know, we've got the right set of controller if you're looking around the game is played around with a bunch of different options about how that works. But it seems like a very simple thing to say, mark up. But yeah, we tried things, blocking that aim to specific angles. So it was a snap with eight ways or four ways. That was all sort of in an effort to try and get the launch off of these bolts to go a particular direction or be more consistent, provide some forgiveness for the player. So I think, ultimately, is locked to a certain direction, but there's a lot of things, it's, it's 16 or 32 or 32 different directions so things can feel a bit consistent but there's still a ton of expressive ability to make decisions or or mess up.

Jonas Rosland  
So I want to dive into the game itself. So, we, we've been talking about it, get a group chat where we've been talking about the mechanics and everything. So, I'm gonna showcase a few things here. We're going to start out with some screenshots and I would love for you to talk to these. When can I see, talk about what we're seeing here.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, so let's check. True. And the veteran. Yes, this is a this is one of the first level performers in the first world, and this is one of like the challenge rooms, and I think this is the one the first time that we're teaching the player to go over static throws before start poking around.

Jon Lawitts  
So it's a relatively early challenge but yeah it's it's a secret area so it's kind of a little bit more difficult because you can see the ground is really dangerous. And there's obstacles in the area. So if you like managing more than one thing was,

Vicky Wei  
oh this is the basement. Factory, which is why it's the first world and it's got that like easy like musty basement, feel

Jon Lawitts  
the background there. The window is actually an art asset that we've added later. There was a couple of spots throughout the game, you know, more unique sort of background elements. So this particular one only shows up in a world. And without this group. I think it comes out pretty late. This is, this one is one of the boss levels. The Chase levels, rather, I always really liked this particular puzzle or this challenge here with. So each of these columns will collapse as you grapple on them. And I think once we put that into the game and this is really fun. This has got to be one of the, one of the chase levels. And yeah, so, in this moment and you can see chips jumping towards one of the battery boxes on the top, I think, this particular one was one of iteration as well, we changed this challenge a lot over and over and over because I'm just getting the exact timing between this sort of wall of goop chasing you, and an element collapsing, and trying to grapple with them all the same time, and sequence as well. tries to get right.

Jonas Rosland  
I love that. I love sequencing, together with the music as well. That's, That's always fun. So I want to showcase a few moving images here for everyone who's watching as well before we dive.

So I want to dive into some of the moving images here as well to kind of showcase how the game looks when, when you're playing it as well so you can see here, Chip, is moving at lightning speed. Grappling grappling all these little, what do you call them buttons or bolts, bolts, that's right. So the, the, the core mechanic here, Grappling these bolts, moving around and finding these small, small little bots that will follow you to the end of the level. And it's just super smooth. I was very, as I said before, I was super super happy with how good it felt. And I mentioned this earlier before the interview as well. I love hard platformers, I have a real hard time when I can't jump, though, so this was a this was a mental shift for me to kind of move into thinking about how, how do I transport myself and kind of move around the levels but as you said, grappling essentially becomes Jumping,

Jon Lawitts  
yeah we I think we found that our playtesting that most people it takes them a minute or two to get their head wrapped around the main mechanics, right, the fact that you can't jump and that you have to do all of your movements, which was interesting to see and it's sort of interesting to see people sort of work through that problem as they're playing it. But yeah, replacing. Most people within, you know, maybe a minute or two of just playing start to get the hang of it and said this about it. You can see sort of the light bulb go off and I feel like once we saw that in our protest. We thought that we're, we're onto something here. And yeah, we didn't really like we

Vicky Wei  
professing the difficulty of all the levels, and just Yes. A lot of these are later. Oh, this is definitely this is one of the harder ones this is like the final room of like the last level, you have to sneak for these projects, well it's not yeah so we definitely have to make sure that progress.

Jon Lawitts  
Incremental wise, as well. Back in your third grade. We think we're looking at us just how often or how much of three is currently dangerous. So, you know, looking at like just the ground for example, difficulty the level, you could maybe measure it by, what percentage of the ground will cause it to move. And then in the first couple levels you can see that there's large stretches of area where it's mostly just fun right you can just travel from point A to point there really aren't that many hazards that can get in the way.

Vicky Wei  
If you messed up you just you just land on the ground and back around.

Jon Lawitts  
And then some of these later levels. There's no safe zones.

Vicky Wei  
And this one's actually easier than it looks, because basically the saws are like once you think the launch is fixed. So, once you want off of it there's like, Why, it's really just some of the stuff just works harder than it is, which is also like.

Jon Lawitts  
We tried to make the challenges in a way that didn't both drugs are good. There was a lot of like close calls, yeah, which was that was a really hard balance as well. I think the testing is invaluable.

Vicky Wei  
Oh that sounds cool because you can go so long. spinning sauce and there's a couple of ways. You want to just like, jump over the top, you can do that or you can just say, Hey, that's a little bit safer as well.

Jon Lawitts  
One of the other things I think that made a big difference. at least for me when when we're working on this terms of how was visual components that go along with it, it's obviously like the timing of everything and spacing, careful about tweaking all that. But there's also a couple of relatively subtle visual elements I think that also does make it much more satisfying. And so when you're attached to one of these bullets you can see there's a little ring that comes out, it's wanting to just kind of indicate that you didn't connect to it, or the packing key notes that come out of the box.

But yeah, so some of them end up being a type of cancer pretty loud. Yeah, so with that being pretty subtle, so you might not even notice it while you're playing but feel the moment where you connect, you know, sort of subconscious assessment,

Rich McGrath  
said, you know your indie company smaller company, how did you go about getting playtesters and going through that process for your game. Yeah. Okay, So,

Vicky Wei  
when it was in person, utilize the yard, which was wonderful and wonderful it's like a bar. And, sorry, but there was one girl is a bar in Brooklyn, runs a monthly play testing and just like people from the community can come in and test out their whatever they're working on the matter, but they also need to then NYU has a game program, and so they run a test Thursday and that's the people that come by. And so we just, we just go out and execute on the feedback. I think we were, we were going out with everything. Like, then once we went off online. That's so we had started like that we'll just set up like OBS just reaching out on social. At first, and then refill and while you

Jon Lawitts  
know, I guess. Sorry, it's a bit of a hustle. Yeah, I mean, you know it's a, it was a good amount of effort to have something ready for these weekly playtesting sessions and also just applied, find them and sort of get the ball for them, does take a bit of effort, but it's,

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, it's so worth it because like, people are so creative and come up with so many different ways to like break it flat and like find so and they try to. Yeah, people are just so like so many different ways of thinking about world and no we will find people like trying to solve something a certain way can move forwards, just like Alice's a great idea. I think one point earlier. He does some illustrate for that. I set it to like under

Jon Lawitts  
typical as well. Yeah, yeah. So sort of like eye opening, just to get someone else's perspective on your idea. He was pretty amazing how some blinds you get to everything really. Especially, I feel like especially in the level design, you're looking at it so much and playing it and came up with it to begin with. So it's really hard to try to distance yourself from that and look at it with fresh eyes. Yeah,

Vicky Wei  
yeah it's like our composer center she, she actually. She said it's basically playing games against your own. It's like playing testing your own. Oh, yeah, actually we had a lot of like friends, like us, okay, really fun story I think blood tests as well. A really big part of like helping us revise the tutorial. Wow. Is she a gamer or is it. Yeah.

Jon Lawitts  
No, I think, maybe she played the original NAS, like when it first came out, but had probably had not played game since. So yeah, that was great. Just to go and play the game with her. Yeah, we made some revisions based on her input,

Jonas Rosland  
a lot of fun. That's fantastic. I love that involving your, your family, I mean, family and friends of course but yeah, the older generation as well.

Jon Lawitts  
We, we also have a group in Boston, where it became a second point testing of twice. Couple of our teammates in Boston. Yeah, so they took it out there and got some feedback as well. I think I think it's generally like a student group. I'm not mistaken, but it's open to the public that sort of thing. So yeah that those sort of local groups have been really great family

Vicky Wei  
just anybody like just trying to get anybody except

Rich McGrath  
you're getting all this feedback, how do you know which stuff you filter through what you want and what you don't want what's good and what's not good. I'm sure you're getting some feedback that that sorry.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, I guess. So, this is a little like production nice so some of them we could tell like, okay, is this like a one second. We knew if it opened up the path for more variety of play, like, it's just like shifting, an asset down. That's, that's what we called live updates, we would sometimes do play testing. People are coming to us, then so feature requests like we generally knew how long stuff to make. So here's a feature request, which is a feature request section. And like we could come in as well, based on the number of times things were getting requested.

Jon Lawitts  
I think a big part of it too was trying during the playtesting, especially if it's in person, trying not to pay too much, just in general, mostly just listen to listen and observe what the person is doing. I think I'll sort of get a lot of information about, oh they're experiencing things based on their body language, smiling or frowning. I think, yeah, just trying to like watch and listen to what their experiences. And then, what they say is sort of, you can maybe have an easier time to predict what their actual feedback based on I feel like a lot of the time will give feedback like oh well I, you know, just generally Oh, maybe I don't really like the way this raffle fields but in watching them you can sort of determine like okay it's actually maybe just a little slow or the angle isn't quite right, or like this, this may be more specific elements of it was something to physically see they were struggling with. So yeah, the combination of of their written what you're saying, along with the sort of moment to moment experience of them actually going through it I feel like, help helped us to sort out exactly what to change. Yeah,

Vicky Wei  
yeah that like immediate reactions. Telling a filter, some of the changes that made you yeah actually we were told we were online actually know how they felt. And it also made for us. Yeah, just like play the game just record, and we'll just being able to tell like based on how much you're trying something over and over again. And we also did say, like, one of the repeated feedbacks was that he asked for more checkpoints, they're actually half the number of checkpoints for a very long time before that was added, and it didn't make the game better.


Jon Lawitts  
One of the things was really hard to know. You know, like we might get a piece of feedback is so along the lines of, like, well, the games really difficult or like this one area I keep dying. Right, the games can be frustrating in this part and so maybe not terribly specific exactly what to do about them. And I think over the course of multiple playtesting session can sort of identify a pattern, and determine that if you did add more checkpoints, it would make the game a little bit easier, but it actually didn't take away from the challenge of it or maybe we were a little hesitant at first like, well, it's going to be too easy or. Let's just make things trivial. Yeah, but once we sort of change that I think game ended up much better because yeah I guess sometimes the direct feedback you get isn't a change that you ultimately want to make and it's sort of a, But the more, yeah, the more feedback you can capture the more sort of notes, you can get on. Maybe the easier it is to determine exactly what area needs to change. Yes. How long data collection, actually we just kind of like different types of buyers. Our. Yeah, yeah, trying to remove your own bias from sort of get blind to a lot of stuff so, trying not to sort of contaminate your, your data with your own opinion.

Vicky Wei  
You can't read through emotionally, like yeah we definitely have emotional attachment content just, You know anyway. I think I spent several days working on a level before I just ended up scrapping before

was an hour, it was a really cool I thought I was gonna actually be more elaborate like level, but it was a little tough to pull off. I think that

Jon Lawitts  
was. So my favorite story that just during production. One of the features that we so ultimately didn't cut it, but we reduced its use. There's, there's this move, you can do. So we've got these anchor points grapple towards them and then they start to collapse. And you can do this relatively advanced mode where you hang on to it as it's collapsing. And while it's sort of partway down plots that you can leave off. And that ends up being like a really challenging move to pull off. Or for someone to sort of organically, discover, because you're on this thing that's kind of breaking and floating, and you just want to get out of it. Oh, originally we had a couple of routes today where you'd have to use this move, holding on to it and then we could walk later. And we found that just people were just getting frustrated by it and there's a small group of people that did figure out how to do it. It also, like, there were more relieved than satisfied, I guess. Yeah, we had, you had this one moment in particular, right at the end of the game I think was the second to last level, where the very first part of the level was using this book. And right after we launched, I think nicely right after. I think it was maybe the first person who saw play the game, And they just got

Vicky Wei  
so stuck for, like, 15 minutes, and we had to tell the chat. So I mean it was really like it was really like. You didn't need to change the whole, the whole, the whole level have been actually read works so that you didn't need this mechanic, except the very beginning. Yeah, and but you could get through the level faster. So we ended up just like doing another thing a couple of units up so you could just like, hold on to it if you want to hold on it. Yes.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, that that one was fun. You know, one of our programs like this mechanic especially and was a little heartbroken I think to see us changing. But yeah, seeing the seeing, like the first person gets stuck down and like, we better ease this up a little bit, I think we ended up patchy for, like, people actually got to that part of the game. Oh, yeah, yeah, we

Vicky Wei  
didn't learn to just try to, there's, oh, there's like a multiple solutions to solving most things you can actually get like through this area by going around, like we were just showing off by that you could go straight through all the bombs.

Jonas Rosland  
So, one of the things that I really enjoyed when we get started the first couple of levels. It reminded me of Megaman for the NDS, where you kind of get stuck, quickly, and you need to figure out how to move past certain obstacles, and how to use your grappling hook in a, in a, use a more functional way. So it definitely reminded me of MegaMan and early platformers, and this is how you teach someone playing the game without having a, like a full on hand led tutorial as well.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, inspiration from devil from Mega Man. I think also, some of the metro games essentially where you'll get these new moves throughout the whole game you have to learn how to use them on the fly. But yeah, that technique where, essentially, lock the player into an area until they've learned that particular, you know sometimes complicated or unintuitive mechanic.

Vicky Wei  
It's safe to as well like like learning. Hey, you can't. You can't die. It's like a significant part of the first level. Yeah. And that's,

Jon Lawitts  
we were kind of mentioned in the earlier section, so that the players could have a bit of fun with the mechanic in between these little learning moments. And that, yeah, that was sort of a direct result of seeing people get locked into a single room that they had to learn and then we realize, well, it's it's not that funny, you know, if you, if you get stuck, like yeah you learned it, but now, there wasn't a moment to like have fun. Yeah. So yeah, we ended up adding that in the beginning of the day.

Vicky Wei  
I think it was like in like world building aspects of it to this like quite a bit.

Guess. Say anything in the tutorial so first of all that just kind of establishes like

Jon Lawitts  
like crazy. Another aspect of difficulty was how we, how far apart the introduction of new mechanics and new bolts essentially come in so you know we've got a variety of different bolts and they've got little different behaviors, and different challenges associated with each one. And I think that was also that was a big part of arranging your introduction to those companies. So we have designed a level around a particular mechanic or particular fault. And as we progress through our play testing and development game. Some of these levels, rearrange the order that they appear.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, oh yeah those okay that's in the last row. It's called major lasers, but it's there suddenly it's like lasers, and that used to be the fifth level of the first world. And it was just like the lasers were so difficult that just mostly like with insurance, because most of the level of skill is on, but like, trying to live like 100 years and I'm still getting much. Yeah, so, yeah, so something like that they went around shifted a couple levels in the first world. Now just like, and that was like the cool part that you can just, just shift lights around to handle progression. And, Oh, there is also the worlds are a level in the fourth world we used to be in the first world, and that level was almost done before we shifted into fourth world but that was actually built building layers, but the fourth rule is attacking. I'm just like, Yeah, okay, let's do it let's just move it to the fourth, as well, and then see with a slight adjustment. It's easier to make weapons difficult than it sounds. So that wasn't that

Jon Lawitts  
easy and engaging for you I think that was probably one of the hardest aspects of making the standard journal is balancing the difficulty, and progression progression of difficulty. I think that not only did we shift, well that was around sort of shift. The introduction of tennis. We also introduced the level of aggression or an aspect of aggression or the player can kind of choose to to tackle a particular level next within sort of that so I mean it's the beginning of each world you have to play the first. And I think, and the second level. But once you get past that, three levels, open up. Which one want to try and tackle next. And in order to beat the world, you can actually skip one level completely. So that, that led us. Well we had a couple of iterations through that whole system work and lock in that sort of thing. But that, what that allowed us to do is to have a level that we could put it towards the end of phase one of these environments. So yeah that that let us sort of have a balance between okay the regular path is maybe a little easier for your more casual players, but then there's these more difficult challenges, even within a single world. But yeah, it took us a while to sort of figure out that balance and it made sense to people.

Jonas Rosland  
So I want to dive into some of the early prototypes that you had as well. And can I showcase these for for everyone who's watching here. So let's pull up some of the early prototype images, first and then we'll also dive into the video.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, so this was a piece of concept art, essentially, we were trying to sort out what the fourth world. Yeah. And we had a vague idea where it was headed sort of fanatically we wanted it to escalate this search, type of facility, high tech.

Yeah, I think there was a little bit of maybe less. And, Yeah, we're working with our artists you creating these pieces of concept art. And I think one of the things that stood out especially for this one, oops in the background, I've got the wall, chips, floating in there. I don't know if we knew exactly what purpose they serve in the factory,

Vicky Wei  
or influence, or the checkpoints eventually because they became the checkpoints I like pneumatic tube, chips, and pneumatic tubes to save them back to the hub. And yeah, so I think they may have come from here actually, but then the tubes itself went into. I think those, those became background lesson and acid tubes.

Jon Lawitts  
We did remove the chips for them and make them work to capacity. Yeah, nurture. Yeah, this was one of my favorites too. This is the wild three which is our abandoned or of the other factor. There was, I think this is one of the first things we did, yeah. I think just the color and like the lighting of the team was like yeah, that's, that's great, definitely see a game there. I think we also spent a lot of time getting sort of a texture of everything right. As you can see this sort of these little like maybe fungus or green moss or something like that. Yeah, yeah. And so, you know, it's sort of like a subtle accent, others but that was something that made the final game. That's just a little bit of flavor in the sort of subtle details. But yeah, we took these pieces of concept and actually sort of into assets that will be used throughout the game so these tubes that are in the background, were an asset that we could place, you know, the sort of flexible version

Vicky Wei  
on it finds finds actually came back and things wires so speaking of like acid. It's actually the defines a change in the wires are similar structure but they like, you know, there's like a wiring harness.

Jon Lawitts  
One of the aspects of this is a concept art in particular was, you notice the background looks like maybe it's a semicircle, or just a cylinder your giant cylindrical room of some sort. And we were looking at this, we're thinking well, It's a 2d game. So how does that work, you know, how can we make this work so I think we ended up being the only 3d asset for the whole day and we've actually took this texture of the windows, and we've mapped it onto a cylinder, and that's in the background and so as you ascend, this room, you can actually see the perspective change a little bit in the background. Ultimately it's pretty subtle, but yeah, we really liked the way that the cylinder looked in the background. So I figured it was worth putting a small 3d asset my background.

Jonas Rosland  
Yeah I agree it looks phenomenal. Let's see what we have next here.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, this is the lasers are on, because we, like, put them in really early on in play testing, and see if there was okay that green thing. We used to have two things you could collect in the trees like screws, and we ended up putting that for a box, because it just like helped make the game a lot more so this chip looks a little different. Yeah. After this as well, and so did the battery boss.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, so this was like one of the early designs experiments in which everyone's originally gonna have this sort of like screen. Dream Life face. But yeah, I think we want it to. Well, I think we want it to go to there. And I think the screen ended up just looking a little, like, No, it's not good it's not cute, necessarily, but it's like bigeye wasn't quite the right tone that we wanted to go for and. And then, yeah, is the design of like his body also was like a little, a little to like old fashioned he wasn't wasn't. Yeah, actually,

Vicky Wei  
yeah the grapple. So the grapple I think you'll see it comes out of the middle of chest body, and two chicks head yeah and as concept art, the grapple on the, on the head was so much better. Oh we just shifted it to the head. And I think you'd like it off because you can really see what the grapple is at all times.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, that was like one of the big focuses for the character design in general was obviously wanting to make characters appealing, but the game focuses around just a single mechanic, so we figured that should be front and center. The main mechanic should be so obvious. At the minute you see character, you can get an idea of what what's going to happen. I think that's ultimately why attend. What kind of offers an affordance right people sort of naturally understand what that's gonna do, even if they've never seen it, and the emergence were available for us to you. Magic, really, no. But yeah, there's some features in here too, cutting like the extra collectibles, you can kind of see it a little bit but the, the battery bots are connected by a row for a table. So we have this like string of them all in a line, looking kind of strange,

Vicky Wei  
actually. So, the, the battery box on there, and how they follow you. Yeah, that makes sense.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, we spent some time looking at that behavior, the behavior actually coding it I remember it was okay, it was it was it was more complicated than you anticipated to get to get the boss to follow you in sort of a pleasing pattern. And, yeah, be able to respond to the player moving very quickly around the world, you know, we don't know exactly what to do next then have them sort of move in the natural way that also took a number of iterations. And I think we also had some performance problems initially tracking all of those bots and their movements, just in the way that we did. So we got there eventually but, yeah, that undermines a lot of revisions.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, just the bots. It's cool, like it feels like it's like visually very pleasing, but only.

Jon Lawitts  
Actually, one of the unlockable skins that we added for the, for the Switch release. It causes all of the checkpoints to be hidden, which makes the game honestly a lot harder. But what that also means is that the battery bots don't get rescued until you reach the end of the level, so you're playing with this particular skill. You can get this law and live by your boss following you dropped off each level, and that's fine.

Jonas Rosland  
That's cool. I think we have some iterations as well yes, here, of chip.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, so we wasn't a left here, I think we're very early, watching the news came later that I think about it, because he's got instantly got the hook on his head. You can see we really liked the idea of the Screen Face, we thought it would allow us to give him more emotion and facial expressions. Ultimately I think he just decided that we're just going to give him the facial expressions, even if he's to be a metal robot like metal, you know, Metal Face. He's still just going to move around, bounce around, be flexible. And I think ultimately, one of the main reasons he was away from us. You can see on the right hand side was essentially the simplicity of the shapes, so you can see these are kind of pretty complicated like his body shape is what is hard to describe just to cut tomorrow, arms, and yeah I think it just ended up looking for a complicated thing, as well. So you can see on the left hand side we're trying to find some nice nice simple appealing shapes that would be much faster, but still get a similar expressive. It's fine you can you can kind of see, you know where you came from, there's one sort of middle button in the bottom right of the left hand side, where that's pretty close to what Chip is we just ended up making somebody a little finger, came a little arms. You can see how it's sort of like two pieces from all his designs, and to come up with the final pair. I still like a lot of these though like how the one with them now, applicable. Yeah, Well, it looks kind of like a frog. It's really expressive. It's very cute, but I think that for that one. Was it was maybe a close decision at one point, but we thought that maybe the, the, coming out of his mouth, over and over in the middle often. Just a little.

Rich McGrath  
Have you thought about, like releasing these on like as an update as like here's some different versions of chip if you want to go through.

Jon Lawitts  
That's actually a fantastic idea, when we were coming up with the different skins for CHIP, equipment, recall them. I think we came up with 1990. We wanted them to all be ponds, so we had, yeah we're just one there we sat down and came up with 90 different skins and ultimate difficulty if we had to pick our favorite papers, yeah, yeah, we went out to eight but, you know, there's always, now there's always room for more. Yeah, so it would be pretty awesome to do like a prototype prototype. Yeah, that would be great. It's a good idea.

Jonas Rosland  
Speaking of prototypes we do have an early prototype video as well. I think ties really well in here. So let's have a look at that and chat a bit about what we're seeing here. I think this is one of the first one this is like,

Vicky Wei  
check this out for playtesting.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, I think we took this was the one that we took out to wonder. Yeah, so, yeah the first letter.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, It was, I think, well received. You can say it's pretty rough though I think the main difference in playing it. It's just the controls feel very stiff. You can see a lot of the main idea is here. But yeah, it just didn't feel good. Yeah, it's not very forgiving on the joystick. Yeah, you can see it here like farmers in terms of like maneuver. The Amer up and down. And the, oh, Another thing is like, it was originally going to be. And we ended up opening it up. Just walk into like hazarding eye. And how do you make it feel,

Rich McGrath  
obviously, just looking at the site and playing the game, it feels different, like, what, what is that process to make the controls feel the way that they feel I don't know how to explain that better.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, there was actually a lot of, like, goodness in the controls that we ultimately put in and I think a lot of the process was really going through play testing and identify where something didn't feel quite right. I think a lot of the time the solution to that was adding, essentially, forgiveness, so making it. I'm trying to make the game behave in a way that the game does what the player is intended to do, even if it didn't actually push those buttons, exactly the right way. So just as an example like one of the things that we added is. This may be a little bit on on the technical side of things, but when you press the button to actually grapple, you would expect for the grapple comes out and the push of the button you're expected to grapple. One of the areas where we added this forgiveness is, if you were to press the grapple button a little early right so let's say you press it, nothing comes out and then you want to press it again. If you press it before the grapple is actually for come back to you. Originally, nothing would happen. Right so you press the button a little too early, and because they hadn't fully reset yet, nothing would happen so we added this forgiveness where if you press a button a little early or late, the grapple will still come out. And so yeah like on the code side it's not exactly intuitive to say okay, you know, read the input early, and then apply it later. It ends up getting, making things like a little AI player it just feels very natural right, push the button gets out, even if it wasn't perfect. Another area was just in players, essentially are like in the characters. Not fever wheels. Oh, we were seeing that people would make an attempt to land on a platform or edge, and they would miss it by, like a fraction of a pixel. And just because they were a little bit. They wouldn't make the job, and it's very frustrating because it looked like you're gonna make it, and felt like you've done everything right, but they still like mess. So it just yeah just didn't feel just didn't feel right, even though technically they did miss it. So you know we have added this forgiveness where even if you're a little below the ledge. As long as you're within a certain rate, we're just sort of nudge you on top of the platform. And yeah, It just feels feels better feels more natural.

Vicky Wei  
Floor three has a lot of this in it. So we actually looked at breaking down how to just like itself is missing the combat. Yeah, I think it was actually the combat as well. Oh, yeah. Throwing it x or something but we're just it didn't directly translate over. Yeah, it was combat, but the way they have things moving, was very forgiving, and it was and I knew this because I hadn't played a lot of the combat games he was the first one. And I realized, like, Okay, I have a lot of stuff in there so we were just like, okay, fair,

Rich McGrath  
like when a player says oh this game feels really good it really, it's because it's not really accurate it's actually forgiving the mistakes they're making.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah. And, but, you know, ultimately when you're playing the game. I think most people don't notice these sort of things at all, which is great because you'd want them to sort of be happening behind the scenes, and people just getting into a flow and just enjoying it and not worrying about Oh was I off by two pixels or push this button in exactly the right millisecond, more just being a natural extension of Thera knows. Yeah, I feel like quiet. Yeah. I think the other, the other half of it is literally millisecond by millisecond timing of movements of the grapple and the distance as well. So I think we spent a good amount of time tweaking Exactly. Yeah, the grapple would be. And then, actually, a point of like forgiveness as well is right so when you, when you go to grapple out in this professional version here you can kind of see it but you really have to get the girls don't

Vicky Wei  
like to miss that collectible there, even though you're, like, quarter away.

Jon Lawitts  
And it's just didn't feel great to again be like a pixel off, or spend a lot of time like carefully aiming the stick in exactly the right direction. You want to be able to just sort of get a sense of where they wanted to go to go there.

Vicky Wei  
Yes, so yeah the grapple I think wire is a little bit larger than the actual art assets.

Jon Lawitts  
It's approaching twice as large.

Vicky Wei  
And there's actually a collider table as well, that so if the if the table like this within the vicinity anchor yourself. So it's actually not just the grapple hook that allows you to use. You can also use the table.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah that's we found that if people grapple too early, beyond the point, so then the table would collide with that as well. So yeah, it's sort of like these unintuitive changes or tweaks. But once they're in there you don't even notice it become completely into it.

Jonas Rosland  
I definitely enjoyed those forgiveness as I, as I said before, it's a really fun game, but yeah, I'm having, I'm having trouble aiming in things like that so that forgiveness is very welcome in my book, I was playing the Crash Bandicoot remake on switch. Quite recently and they don't have any forgiveness at all. Yeah, it's it's really really hard on you when you're, as you said you're like, two pixels off of an edge or something, I'm like no I landed that. And they're like, no, no you fell off and you lost a life well here it's more forgiving but it also then allows for a better flow. And in my mind, it's easier to get into a flow and have fun with it. Instead of trying to make sure that you don't miss those two pixels.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, yeah that's great and that's your hope that people have that experience as I played here it was definitely something we're focusing first wasn't three months or so of production was just getting a chance to feel right, and to get the graphical feel right and so we actually spent a lot of time with a game that kind of looked like this. Just to get the character to be exactly right, before we built out dozens of levels based on those exact metrics,

Vicky Wei  
because I knew after that any changes to the character with simultaneous change to all levels, Like, these are the levels where

Jon Lawitts  
we have tried to come up with a set of rules for our own level design. In terms of how far apart things would be how tall a jump, might be, or how far away is to get from each other. And we actually, we built a couple tools to help sort of measure, measure those things as we're designing the levels, because it kind of in a similar way that we want players to feel like, you know flow and they're, they're playing the game. want it to be able to create the levels, quickly and easily and get into a flow in designing them. And that's really hard when you're kind of fighting with work with trying to make something new and there aren't necessarily things out there that are going to meet your Exactly. So we ended up extending unity a bit.

Vicky Wei  
That was a lot of custom tools that we have. Yeah, and so you create, there's a minimum, maximum distance between occurs. That will mean going in to be set up so I don't have any acreage to two units of this space together, and they don't extend for them. Let's say this far apart because you can always get to anchor from easily

Jon Lawitts  
as well. Yeah, yeah, we want them to be within reach. And yeah, it ties back to after you can make a jump that's, let's say 12 units wide, but it's just not as fun as making a jump, that's quite a few slides so

Vicky Wei  
we can definitely make it but

Jon Lawitts  
yeah. So yeah this screenshot here is, is of unity, and you can kind of see some of the some of the tools in here, in the, in the top left there's circles there, and that's actually indicating the path that some of our moving anchors are one spin in a circle. And so we need to visualize it, so that we can measure the distance between them, as there are certain points around the circle. Yeah, or if they were going to go within a wall for.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, yeah and yeah cuz we would have them pass through the like lava. All the other hazards.

Jon Lawitts  
And see, yeah another in the bottom right there's a class of music icon. And so that is just, it's an indicator that the music is meant to change over to the next section. When you reach that point. So, when you when she walks through that zone right there. The music will switch over to the next move. And this level particularly remember there's like a crazy part of the music that's supposed to be in time with these huge conveyor belt, accelerated jobs.

Vicky Wei  
Everyone's like, Yeah, that one's like, precise but it's mental I made to fly a little bit it's quite easy. It's like, like a little.

Jon Lawitts  
It's one of the tools to make sure that the music was kind of match. action. Again, sound icon is that the different sounds of the sure tips on those ones were for. Consider there most of those are associated with conveyor belts, maybe a little small screen but the conveyor belts have been found that they're playing constantly have like Chinnery kind of moving. And so yeah, those are indicating objects that will play a sound like that. You can kind of see them in the center there's three right in a row, I think that's actually some moving anchors. They have like sort of a clicking sound that they'll make a move on the track. When you're too close to them. So yeah, those will indicate the area where you can hear. We're using F mod, which is like a piece of middleware, work with our sound designer closer to get this out. So yeah, those are like an F mon icon.

Jonas Rosland  
Yeah sorry go ahead. Rich

Rich McGrath  
was the reason for selecting unity over I think unreal is now open to what was the reason behind that 

Vicky Wei  
Familiarity. It noodled around quite a bit. And so, he knew he could run a little bit. One is about. We have some background knowledge so I

Jon Lawitts  
think some of the tools that unity has for making a 2d games are a little bit more refined than then

hasn't been focused on 3d Obviously, I think, I think that was part of the decision as well.

But maybe one other aspect is that we wanted. I think the, the editor in Unity was like a big selling point and allowed the whole team to sort of have a central point where they could be contributing to the game or see see and play the game, relatively easily without meeting a bunch of programming experience or have to learn the game. So that, that was also a big selling point it's maybe why they didn't go with the smaller frameworks that being said,

Jonas Rosland  
I want to go back a little bit to the musical platforming segments. Did you take any inspiration from Raman there at all.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, those three big fan of games in general. Yeah. And I think we know Raymond's obviously got levels in there almost like Guitar Hero. Yeah,

Jon Lawitts  
they're perfectly timed here you have to jump exactly on the theater. I think we wanted to go with something else we are here already and more.

Vicky Wei  
Sir, just, I mean still allow you to like, precise, but the music hunters in gameplay just adjust to a little bit more. And so basically yeah so music bubbles. Basically what will. It's actually like very similar to music policy for us. So, it's like a concept called camping. So, when we were working closer. Yeah, practice. No, but want to split this into about sections, or, or just like where you think their conception of them in a measure or two. So we took that user and then we actually look at

Jon Lawitts  
the level. Those levels. Yeah, it was actually really great to work with the compositor. We had a bit back and forth. We've got some early sketches of the music especially for the fossils, pretty early on. This consider. And so we were able to put those into the game really quickly, and nothing spells, and, yeah, ultimately, essentially designed the whole level of excitement for the boss levels. Then, I think that that went so well that we actually went back through all of the levels, made sure that all of the moving objects were all kind of moving to same V for the music. And I think that that was something we realized later on but really nicely and even if you don't notice it, that, that that exact thing is happening.

Vicky Wei  
You can kind of feel it yeah you can feel a little bit loving so even though I in the same in the same world. Like I'd say the second world, even though it's like the swimming changed. They actually, the timing. Obviously, changes. I know they come up with. And yeah, it feels like, really. Yeah, you're going through all that and I think it really helps the players a lot. They make us feel. Otherwise, it was gonna get really confusing so I have to use it. And then also, are the obstacles moving a certain way. So, it's just like synchronize.

Jon Lawitts  
We've actually got this giant spreadsheet of every music track, and like a formula to calculate how many milliseconds are between humming I'll say, seconds, he takes that we can time things out. You know, as we're tweaking the levels like okay, platform needs one or to be slower. We'll take one or two this longer to move. That's awesome that two beats to it. That's fine.

Jonas Rosland  
That's really cool. Yeah, that, that must have been some spreadsheet.

Jon Lawitts  
I think we actually, that we had this one for like master spreadsheet that included a ton of stuff about the production in general like has listed out every single prop and every

Vicky Wei  
sound. Yeah, every level of what each like level is intended to be themed and yeah and then there's one on and like what well Mrs for. So yeah, because we are basically giving the concept art to the composer to help guide her to determine the musical field as well.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, no, that wasn't honestly helpful to have everything listed out and I think I was like a common problem in general I think is, is keeping things on schedule and releasing at the right time that we, we try to approach this in that we had a single mechanic, we thought, okay, well there's, there's just one main mechanic so that'll keep things simple and. But yeah, it's, it was always like, their statement or just, you know, the final lists of everything that we ended up making exponentially larger than our initial expectations, and I suspect that that happens a lot. So being able to actually see it in a spreadsheet, and be able to know definitively okay if we just make these 1020 things, then it's not 100%. Right, that's really, it's really useful to have kept us on track.

Jonas Rosland  
I have another question regarding the music for the game. So the first level or so I can't remember which one it is. But I as I was playing it, I get this really strong Kill Bill feeling and I, and I didn't run it really understand why until I talked to rich, it's because of its surf. And I'm just wondering, how did you come to the conclusion, let's add some surf music to a game about jumping robots or swinging robots. 

Jon Lawitts  
That's a great question. 

Vicky Wei  
I think

you expand outside of like the goal, genre and like more move into like about the environment, and that like game as well so just like, don't overlook that like, it's almost like it's like all this stuff, I guess, but, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, so yeah,

Jon Lawitts  
we've actually seen the composer perform just like in a rock show. And I think after we saw that, like, you know, This would be great for a game, sort of outside of maybe your normal game type musical genre. And, yeah, I think I think we're also tried to leave a lot to the composer like we tried not to, you know, not. We gave them concept art, to tell them what was going to be happening at that particular part of the game, but I want to enforce too much about exactly what the final result is going to be. And I think we only, There was only like two songs maybe where we thought a different direction would be better. Yeah, okay, one of them,

Vicky Wei  
that essentially like me redirected from I think was the finale music for the game, because I think what actually ended up happening but it was the Russian national anthems written.

Jon Lawitts  
It sounds great but I don't use it, Really. Yeah, I think there's some like subconscious information leaking in there. But yeah, I think, you know, ended up being actually quite a lot of music written, there's 13 tracks or so.

Vicky Wei  
So yeah, it currently. Yeah, so that's what I wanted to work with Superman because like, they, when we saw them perform, they were like, they had a lot of jazz, but also a lot of metal and that was actually like some elements of like a catchy pop and. And then like, and then a lot of classical employees as well so wanted to like have that variety that we did, didn't think the third world there's not the one. So, there's, there's a level that's called a think tank, or something like that but it sounds very hip hoppy and it's catchy and it's so good. But yeah, That's like my hip hop and there's, there's a piece referenced at some point in one of the songs.

Jon Lawitts  
There's one of the boss levels has some broccoli.

Jonas Rosland  
I love that you're trying to expand the game musically. That way, I really enjoy the soundtrack, and it's on Bandcamp as well I believe

Jon Lawitts  
it's on Spotify, you can pick up a copy of it on Bandcamp that's probably the best place to get it if you want to get a copy. You can also get it on Steam and.

Jonas Rosland  
So, another question about expanding the game itself. So, the, the game is available in English and Japanese. What was the reasoning behind that translation choice and how, what was the process like to translate the game into Japanese.

Vicky Wei  
It was super actually really fun. Start off with that I was really doing the translations.

A translator, and someone to talk to composer because free rein to interpret it is. Oh, I guess like started, he chose one blank. A couple reasons. One is it filled out our transaction,

and knew we wanted to, we weren't sure how difficult it would be. And then so we knew we wanted to do it for this pitch. And so, process was basically, we chose Japanese personally just based off people or some Japanese players that were really interested and development wise, we would probably be a tricky language to work with.

Jon Lawitts  
Here we figured it was pretty dramatically different from English, and that might present some challenges in terms of actually getting into the game. So yeah, we thought that if we're just going to do one language that's maybe a good one to start with because it will run into a number of things that he saw. And if we can do that one should be able to do any other. I think the only thing we haven't tried to tackle yet is right to left line. Because that's another, Yeah. Eventually, we'll get there. Yeah. Overall, so we've had some issues before in other contexts. And that was typically like a larger process where it's getting translated into languages and and working with a large company to actually provide the translations. And I think, at least in my experience have always been extremely complicated and difficult to get the thing translated and then get the languages into the game. We're a little nervous about going into it. We picked one language to do is easier, because we actually,

Vicky Wei  
we actually did like so we were able to establish our structure for unity, like, luckily we just released a new feature, like two weeks, four weeks, we didn't use an experimental unit for the translations but it worked out fine.

Jon Lawitts  
Most of its experiment. We were looking at tools to help with this sort of thing. And yeah, we got lucky. You've released a preview version there localization tools, and we'll try them out and they work good. So, and they work on the switch.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, it's actually basically a spreadsheet of all the tests, the game. And so we knew, there's the possibility that we want to try translation. That's why there's actually almost no testing the game. I think there's only like 200 words, total and most of that is in the menus. Yeah, so, um, so like we actually designed it, knowing that we might want to minimize the complexity of it. And then so later on when. Basically it's a spreadsheet, and then all the English is in one column and then there's a, there's a lot of every level. Every skins upon. We and there's a lot of practices, and basically, there's a, there's a column that adds friction and a reference to that joke, and then so, just like what that is for the translator and then he just thinks through. Just let him

Jon Lawitts  
run out there so further are actually translated and worked with the single person. And I think that was actually a much better large company, because it felt a little bit more personal. We were able to have like more direct conversations about what something meant. But yeah it was a little strange to spend, I spent a couple of hours like explaining every joke is actually in the spreadsheet just writing out what the joke was supposed to be.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, and the reference like there's, they're like really big fans of Arrested Development, and archer, and, like, they're so there are a lot of Archer interesting, different parts of shows, like, yeah, dig into to find. The actress has passed away yesterday. Yeah, yeah, just, yeah, I think there's like some quotes or quotes or are so amazing, that's so yeah she's really incredible. Too bad. Yeah. And then, yeah, so, um, yeah, the law the translations like had to like carry over nearly culturally significant shows us something in Japanese, I think there's like the the first level, we're on is, like, it's going lower. I think, and I think that levels just caught like only in Japanese. Has that cadence.

Jon Lawitts  
So it's like the difference between translation and localization, one, you know, translation between you take each word and translate it, whereas localization localizations like making it appropriate for that culture and that that language. So without that one stuck out in particular, because the level name or not that was a reference this cell is more just like a sound. Yeah, and that's a repetition.

Vicky Wei  
Commercials from the 90s. Right, yeah. Prices role is very obscure, like, yeah, so that's, That's what we intended as but yeah, he's a really good job translating,

Jon Lawitts  
so So guardado in Japanese, I think it's just like another mafia. That is the sound of something tumbling. Yeah. You know, if you look up, rolling, rolling, rolling in, like to translate something I've ever come up with the translator. To do so, actually yeah it was really great to work with him, and it went very smoothly, yeah it was really fun. We'll definitely do that again. Maybe we can expand to some more languages.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah and like so we've when I read it just for fun, it was just like really fun to like, just like put stuff into Google Translate and see like what things are translating to it, and we have like, like, you know, language classes, and new, like there's just like flying culture it's really fun to just like learn all of that.

Jon Lawitts  
And I think there was a couple of cases to where, especially working with tendo where I think it was better that we had mechanism there. It's hard to say for sure, necessarily, but as part of like, you know, permitting the game. I did submit the Japanese name as well. And I think, I think it's paid off, we have a couple of life jackets fans been some like fan art that's come through, people made like pixel art of chip and the battery bosses 1000s It seems to me pretty excited about the jacket.

Jonas Rosland  
So speaking of the the switch you launched on switch yesterday. How did the launch day go. 

Vicky Wei  
It was great. Yeah, we got recommended on Instagram as well. Because like video games are like a different genre of musicians like encouraging musician who can write things. It's really cool. And it's very collaborative. And then we did a, we did a fun lunch as well, and watch it got trees to play. They only run tech in further events online, but yeah they make something helpless out there that was really fun. And think softly, like that is really bad as well. Really so about,

Jon Lawitts  
I think a lot of our day yesterday was making sure that everything was released correctly and it all went smoothly, but once that's all done we spent a lot of time on social media and making sure that people knew about it, following up with anyone who had posted about, about the game during the live events, a lot of work. And, yeah, it's so far, you know, so far the views have been very good. Yeah, I'm pretty happy with that day one patch either. Yeah, we haven't had to patch the game, that's, that's really cool.

Rich McGrath  
I know you can patch the game because you can always make changes, updates, add new things but eventually you do have to move on. Does it ever feel like the games finished, or you're just abandoning it.

Jon Lawitts  
It's tough, there's, there's definitely things left on the table, you know,

Vicky Wei  
a lot of cool ideas that like, and, like, yeah, chicken, pickup essentially do a lot of different moves that really open up the world in the future.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, I think. Now for this game, I think, you know, we'll see there's there's a couple of things. Especially, but yeah, we started some conversation about some areas that maybe we want to have this particular thing. So yeah, it certainly feels like never ends. But yeah, at the same time I think we'll need to just set aside, work on something else. But who knows, you know, maybe there is a chip sequel in our future. Yeah, that sort of thing.

Rich McGrath  
Like Sonic 2. And then he has a little partner for number two and now there's two.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, we're talking about. I think that would be a great thing. Sequel.

Jonas Rosland  
So, hold off on on the sequel news until you have something to announce, I guess, but we all know, okay. So, what about the, the indie scene right now. What are you excited about within the indices, you said you started this game you start developing on the game, roughly in January last year, quick, quick turn around, you got the game released on Steam, it's now out on switch. What are your feelings about the indie scene in general alone What are you most excited about, within the next few years.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, I think the indie scenes are very dynamic and there's still, there's like, really really cool ideas that people are coming up with and I think like a lot of games are pushing the boundaries here. And you can see each other. And, yeah, we've actually been influenced by indie games, as well as these can be really cool to sell.

Jon Lawitts  
I think one of the things that's been great is just how open. Everybody is to sharing their experience or sharing information, or discern anything. And, yeah, that's been really useful especially in our play testing, trying to get gains and losses fall into

Vicky Wei  
helping each other like it's seen in everyone's really open to feedback. We actually like yeah during like we, we like x we really try to like play a lot of things out there just because we have the setup to the screen recording. We really wanted to just utilize that to play something that did some of that play testing as well.

Jon Lawitts  
Yeah, I think we found our transmitter, I think, small group. Yeah. So yeah, some of the like networking stuff so great. And yeah, I think it's, it's tough to be an indie, it's certainly in terms of like budget and overlay resources and just reach, I think, I think the marketing aspects for us in particular are like one of the harder things to try and do, alongside making a game. But yeah, it's great to see that sort of like, very open, supportive of each other. I think that sort of does help. Yeah, getting, getting your name out there as an indie I think is very challenging I think a lot of people probably

Jonas Rosland  
wonder you are, um, what are you. Do you have any suggestions or any tips for someone who's getting started within the indie scene, how to reach out to people how to find people that you might be a fantastic graphic artist or a developer but you don't have the other skills. How do you get started.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, I actually say like, try to go out and buy other things, and then you'll like be able to interact with other game makers and see the works and see how my veterans. Yeah I think that's how we've actually reached out to some of the games, like, just like whether you're going to like Boston Indies,

or just going to want to. One day, like, we actually went to see what was happening and see like what went in Sunday. Yeah, there's a lot of work in progress.

Jon Lawitts  
I was gonna say there's very likely, a kind of local group that you can seek out. If you're looking to sort of get involved. And I think if you look around, I'm sure there's somewhere that has like an open, it's an open call and we were lucky in that, at least initially in this project we had sort of two weekly or monthly ones that we found were able to go to. And so that, that was great. Yeah, just to meet other people that are making games and also, I think that's enormously important. I guess the other thing that comes to mind in terms of just getting started out, is just to make stuff, you know, if you can't make something or even if you're learning about like something, just doing it I think most experience, because it's always very hard when you're just starting out, and I think. Yeah, I think, keep things small, keep it contained, but don't, just don't stop eating just making stuff. I feel like one of the, one of the aspects of that. One of the aspects that led us to this was our willingness of the teams wanting us to sort of just dive into it, because a lot of the information about how it's supposed to work and how to get the game actually on the switch is not public, so you have to be able to sort of just dive in feedback.

Vicky Wei  
And yeah, there's also a dive in. I mean, we weren't sure about for switch release. Yeah, we just,

yeah, I was like, okay, yeah I guess this ties, like, yeah, like getting yourself out there, whether it's just like going to the protesters so it was actually really the first lighthouse, or how to, like, do that, like, but okay if there's like visceral hatred, it's. They really don't like the negative feedback.

Jon Lawitts  
I think what you don't want, is if someone shrugs. Fine. You kind of want them to have a visceral reaction whether it's very positive or not. That will give you something to go off of. Just like yeah whatever that may be foster attention to. So, but yeah, you know, I mean that in terms of advice for getting started out, I know. It's definitely not easy. And, you know, the secondary side the production site goes down. A lot of status. Just one other thing that may be good to keep in mind as you know, don't be afraid to cut things or change course or rework something that's just not okay. I think there were a lot of things, cut from this game but to be honest I don't. Yeah. Cuz, ultimately I think the game is much better off because we've, we've tried to keep it as focused as possible, so the mechanic and a single sort of focus. And yeah, all the things that maybe we felt strongly about initially right now are not important. Just it's fine. So yeah, don't be afraid to cut things out as far as like killing your diet and sort of a morbid.

Jonas Rosland  
So, diving into how to get your word or your name out there speaking. Let's, let's start that over. So speaking of getting your name out there, Where can people find you on the interwebs.

Vicky Wei  
Yeah, okay. So, our website is start.io then there you can find us on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and discord and depending on your platform of choice. So, that is world that start IO platforms as well, and better like you can see our daily updates on Facebook as well in the chat. We're on display. Awesome, and rich.

Rich McGrath  
Oh, yep, I'm RW McGrath and everything RW McGrath. COMM real easy.

Jonas Rosland  
And I'm at Jonas Rosland and you can find us at head tube.org Thank you so much John and Vicki and rich. This has been fantastic, talking to you about Get a grip chip. It's super fun, highly recommend everyone to check it out. And as we said, it's out on switch now as well if you want to in portable mode. Highly recommended. Go check it out.
