# Wintermoor Tactics Club interview transcription

**Jonas Rosland:** [00:00:00] hi everyone. And welcome to another indie game preservation interview here at Hit Save! Today. I have with me some of the team members behind Wintermoor tactics club. Please introduce yourself. We'll start with Ben. 

**Ben Walker:** Hey, my name is Ben. I was the team lead on Wintermoor tactics club, as well as the programmer on it.

**Kyla Fury:** All right. Hi, my name's Kyla. I was one of two writers on winter, more tactics club 

**Ryan Anderson:** and I'm Ryan and I did combat designer. 

**Jonas Rosland:** [00:01:00] Awesome. And I'm Jonas Rosland executive director here at Hit Save!. Yeah, we're going to talk about the winter more tactics club today. And, but before we talk about the game I want to dive a little deeper into who you are all behind the game here.

So can you tell me a bit about how you get started in game development? What was your motivation? And since we have many members here of the team, which is fantastic we'll kind of go around the around the clock here. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. Same order. Yep. No works. Sounds good. Great. Yeah. 

**Ben Walker:** I started in video games.

So when I was 17, I want to go into the university of Southern California for college in computer science, computer engineering, kind of a very normal thing, but it turned out that school had a major in video games. And I, as a 17 year old said, I love video games. I want to take this major. So I did. And when I graduated, I was lucky enough to get a job doing video [00:02:00] games at Microsoft.

I started out on the connect wound up moving to the halo games and got to ship halo five. At which point I discovered AAA games. Aren't really the thing for me. So I wound up quitting and founding an indie studio to make the game that became winter more tactics club. Yeah, 

**Jonas Rosland:** that's really cool. So next up we have.

Yeah. 

**Kyla Fury:** So I grew up always wanting to be a writer from a really young age and just kind of like doing games as sort of a side hobby thing and studying, writing, and going to writing groups. And then when I was around 16, I got for Christmas final fantasy 10 and the first kingdom hearts game.

And it was like, oh, Hey look, games can tell stories now, like that wasn't true for a long time. And so I kind of became more interested in this idea of like games as a medium to tell stories that is like different [00:03:00] than other mediums and sort of what's unique about them. And so then, you know, went to, went to school first for creative writing and computer science and undergrad.

And then I also went to university of Southern California for grad school for their MFA interactive media program. And so got my master's in fine arts there and, you know, learning about games as a medium and the intersection of games and storytelling and then worked for a while with a little indie company.

It was then called a Waymo media. But it's, that's had a few other names since then. I think it's we VR now. They do a big VR experience called the blue. But yeah, I worked for them doing at the time we were making an MMO screensaver. Yeah. It's like I could get into it, but it's, it is, it was exactly that it was meant to be like a, an ocean screen saver.

And, but you could like interact with like, you would like buy little [00:04:00] fish to have in your ocean, but then you could send them to other people's oceans and they would like tell you where they visited and things like that. And it was all supporting like ocean conservation charities and stuff. So it was a pretty cool project.

Yeah, it was fun. That was, that was what the blue originally was before it became a VR experience. And then we, then we made a little mobile game called super Fu, which I think doesn't exist anymore because the app store, like, you know, sheds games every like two to three years. If you don't update them constantly try months.

Yeah, yeah. Fair. Yeah. You, you would know more about that ecosystem than I and yeah, so then, you know, I enjoyed working there, but I was looking to move up to Seattle to be, you know, closer to some friends. So came up here and then. I was working on some other non-game related stuff and, you know, got pulled into this project by some friends.

So. 

**Jonas Rosland:** Awesome. So your, your writing and [00:05:00] storytelling are you taking more from final fantasy or you're taking the somewhat maybe nonsensical approach looking at kingdom 

**Ryan Anderson:** hearts? 

**Kyla Fury:** Well, so listen, tread carefully because the kingdom hearts series is beloved to me. I will sit and explain the plot of that game for four hours to you.

Mark my words, 

**Ryan Anderson:** At some point then you'll move on to kingdom hearts to, 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. So I don't know. I really like the, the sort of uniqueness of games as a medium for storytelling. Like I like thinking about how games can tell stories through their mechanics, as much as through traditional things like dialogue or, you know, text.

And I think there's some, there's a few really neat things you can do when you force the audience member to be a participant in the medium. That, you know, have to do with [00:06:00] sort of empathy and encouraging like certain behaviors and thought processes that is communicates in a way that writing can't do in any other medium.

I mean, I was, you know, I was attracted to final fantasy 10 and kingdom hearts because they were doing literary things that I hadn't seen in games before. Like final fantasy, 10 starts in media rests. It has a framing where, you know, it's like right before the final battle. And then most of the game is like a flashback up to that point, which I'm like, I haven't ever seen that in a game before.

That's really cool. And kingdom hearts had this weird, like Multim, you know, franchise thing where you went to different places that were all from different stories and they were interwoven in interesting ways. But both of those games have a very traditional linear RPG. Like let's just stop and have a short movie explaining what's going on kind of thing.

So you know, in part my, my time at school kind of introduced me a lot more to like, okay, but you know, what, what did the [00:07:00] mechanic, what story did the mechanics tell? Like what, you know, how do you interweave those pieces? So we myself and the other writer, Mike ended up working pretty closely with Ryan on making sure that like the combat mechanics were in support of the narrative and vice versa.

So that's my kind of outlook and taken on right game writing. 

**Jonas Rosland:** I love it. And yes, I, I'm absolutely going to take you up on. Your offer there around kingdom hearts. I would love for someone to explain the 

**Ryan Anderson:** story to me. 

**Kyla Fury:** That's like giving me a Christmas, like I would be so happy. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Alright, Ryan. Yeah. So my origin story, I was always a weird lonely kid and I grew up in a rural area, so it's kind of like Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes.

And usually like the main way I engage with people when I was younger was by play and like kind of creating imaginary games with them and stuff like that. So when I first got my like first like video game console and [00:08:00] was introduced to that and like playing around with computers and stuff like that it was kind of like, oh, I can get a computer and like make a version of how I play with people.

And then just like outsource my human interaction to as many people as possible. And then the like me. So then yeah, from basically when I was around, like, like as soon as I was aware that it was a thing I could be, I wanted to be a game designer even more than just like player or anything. It was literally like the process of making games as well.

I was most attracted to. So yeah, kind of really focused on getting into a college where I could do that. And around the time I graduated high school, UC Santa Cruz had a computer science game design. So it was the typical computer science major, but I had a lot of kind of media classes worked into it and a few game development, specific courses.

So you can kind of focus on that. And yeah basically a week before I graduated I managed [00:09:00] to land a job as a game designer at a free play mobile company. Did lots of level design on like bubble shooters for the most part. As it bounced around the bay area, I did about almost two years at a robotics company randomly working on kind of toys to life stuff.

One thing I was just, as a developer, I've always been interested in is like getting to design for like new systems and new challenges and everything. So ultimately the kind of like fast follow nature and like very profit driven nature of free to play mobile really burned me out and made me kind of set goal.

And there was a bunch of like major layoffs that kept happening. So it kind of felt like I'm selling out and it's not paying. And I, through a friend and everything was introduced to Ben like basically right after a major layoff when I was looking for work and landed a part-time combat design role on one of our tactics.

And it was kind of like my first chance to [00:10:00] like really like strike out, work on like an, a D project and have a lot more kind of ownership of my work and had worked on a game where the main goal was, you know, to make the best game that we could. And with a lot of like care for the player and stuff, which felt a lot better for me at everything.

So yeah, I picked up this job along with my current gig on team meet and struck out to like live in my cousin's trailer in Oregon and downsize a bit from my bay area life. And yeah, I've been doing indie stuff since but yeah, mostly mostly level design. Just, I have a lot of experience grinding out a lot of content.

So when more tactics club was also like a great opportunity to make a much more polished and focused experience. 

**Jonas Rosland:** Hi, how do you, how do you just randomly spend three years in a robotics company? 

**Ryan Anderson:** Oh, so two, it was basically two years, like one year, nine months. I think I did, I did two projects with them.

I was, it was I think honky they did the overdrive, like the drive and then overdrive series. [00:11:00] And then they also made this a little robot Cosmo. I remember the 

**Jonas Rosland:** auntie that, that was the, a racetrack thing. That was a big hit at one of the apple events. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Right, exactly. Yeah. They hired me about a year after they kind of blew up from that.

I was part of like the big hiring. From that. But yeah, it was just a, it was a place that I had looked at and convinced myself. I wasn't like good enough to work there, but it seemed really cool. Cause it was like toys to life. It was like robots acting out in the physical world games. So like it had interesting new mechanics and like new things to consider when you were like coming up with stuff for it.

And yeah, they ended up actually having a recruiter reach out to me after I had like past like even applying and ended up yeah, getting a technical design role on that. So I did a lot of like UI stuff and building tools for the game design team and everything. But then they kind of pivoted away from toys and into a more consumer robotics right after Cosmo launch.

So I [00:12:00] got laid off along with the game design team. And yeah. But no, I, I definitely, it was a really interesting kind of like a side in my career and yeah, I don't think still exists. I think they went under a few years later. But Cosmo got picked up by something else. So I think, I think that little robot still lives as they like teaching kids how to program kind of stuff.

**Jonas Rosland:** That's neat. Yeah. As a, as a parent I'm definitely looking forward to doing robotics with my daughter as well. I think that's going to be super cool. 

**Ryan Anderson:** There's a lot of great stuff out for it right now. Oh, it's, it's a 

**Jonas Rosland:** fantastic market right now. I'm having a lot of fun, just looking at things that I want to do in a couple of years.

And in a couple of years it will be even more fantastic. I'm sure. Oh yeah. So Ben, I wanna dive into you talked about your, your background and AAA studios. What made you go, Hey, I want to do this game. I really want to create this. What was the, [00:13:00] what was the backstory to, to the game and the inspiration for the game?

**Ben Walker:** Yeah. You've probably heard if you read Kotaku, like at all this concept of AAA game studios often have a lot of crunch and kind of create these, you know, solace working environments, I think is roughly the way to put us. And 3, 4, 3 is they find a good place to work at, but it does have elements of that, which is to say after I shipped halo five, I was in a very lucky place where I kind of got to checklist big box that I think a bunch of people enter the games industry to check this box of making a game that they, as a teenager, would have loved to play.

And having checked that box and discovered that, you know, my life isn't over and I'm not ready to walk into the CES. And I didn't really have that great a time working on halo five. It's a big came to this question of what do I want to do next? And the answer was I still like video games and [00:14:00] I discovered that this sort of feeling of ICF halo five and you know, it wasn't, it was an experience that I am looking to expand on rather than just repeat for halo six or whatever was fairly common throughout the studio.

So I was talking to an artist who also worked on halo five alongside me named Justin. And he had the exact same feelings I had. And we basically came to the conclusion of, you know, we probably could just start a dangle in the studio. We have the experience because we shipped a game. You know, we are an artist and a programmer team, which has a pretty decent team of two for creating a game and we took off and did it.

So I guess the answer was, everything else seemed even worse. 

**Kyla Fury:** And you were like, I'm going to spend six months making a game.

**Jonas Rosland:** It only took six months. That was all not take six. Of course it did. [00:15:00] 

**Ryan Anderson:** When 

**Ben Walker:** we first started, when justice in life is that's a nice side. We would take off from our jobs for six months and, you know, create this game. At the time it was called Ravensdale academy tactics club. We changed the name from Ravensdale academy to winter more, but, you know, we actually had a fairly similar idea to watch it earlier.

Well, we discovered is you can't get all your ideas into a game in six months. It took three years and nine months to ship the game. That's actually not that bad in depressingly. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. It's especially not that bad for mostly part-time people on a team. Like a lot of, a lot of indie games go like seven years, you know, six in the six to eight range.

**Ben Walker:** Yeah. So the theory is Dustin and I started out on this, you know, the core idea was we wanted to make a goofy game about kids, kind of finding themselves in [00:16:00] a boarding school in winter, 1980s is where we settled on. And all of those things still very much exist in the final product, but we fairly quickly realized that we wanted to have a game that was focused on characters and writing.

And Justin was an amazing artist who actually created the rough concepts for Alicia, Collin, and Jacob, our main characters, you know, quickly. And we settled on them and we were happy, but we needed someone to create better writing and stories than we could, which is how we pulled on Kyla's good friend and the person who eventually convinced me to hire Kylo.

Mike, the other writer and things snowballed from there going from a two first and six month job to about a 10 person three year and nine months. Which is good because we were successful enough to be able to pull that off. But Mike God.

**Jonas Rosland:** So I asked you were growing the team here. You said you ended up with 10 people in total. 

**Ben Walker:** Oh, that's including [00:17:00] like outsourcer contractors, but yeah, we had six people who were kind of the core of the team who we would all talk together on slack a whole bunch. And those of us who were in Seattle would meet every weekend at a Boba place to do you know, stand-ups is what they call them in the tech world.

**Jonas Rosland:** So I, I have a question regarding one of the outsourcing teams that you use there. I was going through the, the credits been playing through the game and I was going through the car that's yesterday. And I saw that you had in a diversity and inclusion team that reached out to us well can you tell me a bit more about how, how 

**Ryan Anderson:** that went?

**Ben Walker:** Kyla was actually one of the people to take lead on that. So, 

**Kyla Fury:** yeah, so that was sort of a, kind of an interesting thing, which is we, you know, because of the, the, when, when Mike and I got there we were already. You know, given these three [00:18:00] main characters, here are your main characters that the story is going to be about.

And you know, the main, main character is a young black teenager. And we were like, well, no one on the team is black. And, you know, we want to make sure that we're, you know, we're like, you know, we worked really hard, like did research. I did, you know, like readings by black authors about being in, growing up in boarding schools.

And, you know, like we did, we, you know, like worked really hard to like think of our characters as three-dimensional people and really think about their backstories and what influences them and like who, who they are as people and their personalities. And, but we also knew that we would, there was a chance that there would be something big that we overlooked that we would screw up.

And we were, we were very conscious of that. So. Like for instance, I had a, I had seen this Twitter thread that someone, you know, I followed, had posted about like, Hey, you know, for people doing media stuff, here's [00:19:00] stuff that most people don't know about black women's hair and like how it, you know, how it needs to be taken care of.

And I'm like, shoot, like, it seems like based on this, that Alicia should probably wrack her hair at night. Like that's a thing, but like, I don't know anything about that. I'm like, you know, I've read one Twitter thread on it. So, you know, you know, I have this general idea. So we're like, we need to, we need to send to like we need to hire a diversity reader.

We need someone who is like gut checking us, in fact, checking us, who actually knows what they're talking about. And you know, there's actually a lot of places that do that now as contract work we were, there's, there's a weird, like there's a few different ecosystems. Most of the time games ones can be a little more expensive because they have to play your entire game.

And that takes a lot of time. But we were able to find a group that does it normally for screenwriting. And we just like gave them our like novel sized script from the game of like, here's all the words in the game that [00:20:00] happens. Here you go. And they were able to like read it as more like, as a novel or screen.

Yeah. And we got some good feedback from that. They, you know, she was confirmed at like, yes, like wrapping her hair would be a thing that you should include. And like, so we made sure that back got in. She told us like, you know, you you're tiptoeing around using the word black at the end, like in the speech towards the end of the game, you can just say black girls, that's fine.

And so, you know, like a little things like that. So, you know, she confirmed for us that we were like mostly going in the right direction, but she also provided us with you know, with some important details and, and some you know, some good stuff to include that I think was worthwhile for for us to have done.

So I'm really glad that we ended up reaching out. I encourage other indie teams to do that. I 

**Ben Walker:** wrote that was almost a compliment that, yeah. There was a conversation between the only two black woman in the school that originally Kylie and Mike were afraid of trying to push too much on the, we are two black people talking to each other and Casey made it [00:21:00] sound, you know, offer wrong or just feel in in authentic.

And the writer's take was actually all the rest of us seems to feel pretty authentic and you should push more on it, which is nice. I don't know. That was a nice to take to have. 

**Jonas Rosland:** I love seeing that. And yeah, I, I agree. Highlight. Definitely more teams, more into developers and AAA studios 

**Ryan Anderson:** for that matter.

**Kyla Fury:** I kind of, I kind of take it as a, given that India, the AAA studios should be doing this. I hope all AAA studios are doing this. And it feels like you might have the excuse of like, well, we don't really have a budget. We don't have much we can do about it, but we, you know, we got it done for it. Wasn't like crazy expensive 

**Ben Walker:** $2,300.

It was fairly inexpensive. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. So, you know, it's worth it. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Definitely, 

**Jonas Rosland:** definitely. If it leads to a better experience for everyone, that's all that matters. That's that's fantastic. So I kind of want to dive into the game here a little more. [00:22:00] So the development process, Ben, you, you touched on this a little what did the development process look like?

You said you, you met at a Boba place for, for some sprints. W w how, how did it look like day to day, week to week, month to month? 

**Ben Walker:** Yeah, we actually tried to keep the fairly classic, you know, best practices I think is the term one nice thing about the studio being created by two people who came from, you know, a 300 person style giant AAA studio is we already had ideas about, we had seen good implementations of pipelines to get people who want to work on a game, to all work on the same game together.

So kind of moving into like more Silicon valley tech style. How does this get implemented? We, you know, everyone was very encouraged to communicate everything and everything was very open on the idea that everyone should know everything that is happening in [00:23:00] the game so that they can change what they are working on in order to better coincide with, you know, what's happening in art or what's happening in audio.

We would have every other week, I would make a big PowerPoint presentation and force everyone to meet up synchronously to watch us. And you know, 

**Kyla Fury:** to talk, start with a cat joke. Oh no, just catch it. It would always start with a bad joke. 

**Ben Walker:** Yeah, it was this problem that I struggled with of how to avoid making this studio feels soulless because I thought of the studio felt soulless.

We would release a soulless game and everyone would immediately forget us. But, you know, when you grow even to just five to 10 people, which might sound small on paper, you find that you need to implement a lot of the pipelines and behaviors that cause studios to ultimately become soulless. So there was always a balance between those two and one way that I tried, you know, putting some soul back in was I love myself to stick a dome slide at the beginning of every update presentation.[00:24:00] 

And they mostly turned out to be jokes. Sometimes they were pictures of her cats. Like here's my cat calculus. I'm sorry that you've been seeing my cats like go across the screen, this conversation. It was fun. And it was a good way to, I think that the game came out with soul. So I guess that part succeeded.

**Kyla Fury:** I'd also, if we're talking like production and pipeline, I feel like we have to shout out Jackie who like other six person team, which is like a, you know, a tiny core team. One of them was a producer and I feel like, you know, Jackie came on and kept us all organized and like doing the things that we said we were going to do.

And like, you know, keeping the deadlines and making sure that the right work was getting done at the right times. And 

**Ryan Anderson:** she was also an all star, every conference, like just really engaged with people and managing the booth and everything like yeah, made it, made it very easy for us to each do like our independent [00:25:00] jobs and everything.

**Ben Walker:** And she genuinely tried to be a helpful person where and we're producer is very overloaded. I think in tech, like many people can have jobs called producer a program manager and do two totally different things, but she was very good at, there were tasks that would fall through the cracks because they weren't really programming and they weren't really, they weren't really designed.

And Jackie was the person who was able to take them all on and just accept that, you know, this task needs to be done and I am the person to do it, which is great. So she is now at another game studio, I think, which is very lucky for them.

**Jonas Rosland:** So with regards to the development process here, so you have it is not released on PC. It is released on on switch PlayStation and Xbox platforms. What did the the porting of the other games. 

**Ben Walker:** Oh, yeah. Thankfully there are a [00:26:00] bunch of outsourcing studios that explicitly exist to port your PC game to other constables.

So we were, we were able to pass a decent chunk of the work to one of those outsourcing studios, a group named kitty face. Funny enough. They were great and it was mostly a programming problem at that point, which meant essentially I spent three months debugging some very nasty memory issues with one of these porting engineers.

As we tried figuring out for what is our switch was the most difficult one, because switch has the lowest amount of resources. Cause you know, it's a handheld device as opposed to the X-Box one on PS4. So we spent a lot of time figuring out how to reduce file sizes and how to deal with the fact that it's memory loading architecture was different than everyone.

Else's it meant a lot of doing that. It was kind of a pain. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Would 

**Jonas Rosland:** you would you do it again? 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. Oh my 

**Ben Walker:** God. Switch. You know, this is a bit of a like bloodless business decision, but switch [00:27:00] sold better than Xbox and PlayStation four. It's sold almost as well as PC, which is our number one seller. Yeah.

You know, in terms of the ratio of effort put into results come out. Absolutely. 

**Jonas Rosland:** I'm currently playing it on my switch. Just because of that, of the handheld. It's just fantastic. You're good. I got a PC. I got PlayStation. If I can play it on handheld, that's what I'm going to do. And I would say it's a perfect couch game as well.

It's super chill. Just reading through the stories. I've been having a blast going through the game and just exploring talking to all the NPCs and, and all the other characters here. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Super, super fun. 

**Ben Walker:** Do you want to talk about ? Am I pronouncing it right? Oh, 

**Kyla Fury:** Hooga or Higa I don't Jackie actually J yeah, hiking.

Jackie's the one who actually knows how to pronounce it correctly. It's a Danish question, mark. 

**Ryan Anderson:** You mean he'd get, yeah, yeah, [00:28:00] 

**Jonas Rosland:** yeah, yeah. I just Googled it. Yeah. So I'm from Sweden. We have the same thing, which is called a FICO. 

**Kyla Fury:** Okay. So you can, you could probably explain it at least as well as I could, if not better.

But this, yeah, the concept of like coziness and like getting to like, hang out with friends in a warm and like soothing environment. So we always like at cons and things, we would say like, yeah, this is a game that we want you to like curl up with the way you would curl up with a good book. Right? Like drink your hot chocolate, like be in a nice little blanket, maybe have your switch and, you know, play it, play it in a it's a cozy game.

We want it to feel. Yeah. 

**Jonas Rosland:** I absolutely agree there. Yeah, as I said, I've been having a blast playing through it. I'm I'm a slow, slow reader. But I, I really enjoy the witness. I was cracking up when I was going through the library and just reading the descriptions of all the all the different parts of the library.

Although 

**Ryan Anderson:** the oldest 

**Kyla Fury:** shelters, I [00:29:00] love the library, Mike and I hit hid two separate references to Jorge Luis Borges has in in the library. And it's, it's like the library is the best combination of our, like most highbrow literary jokes with our like absolute dumbest low level. It's like the full, full range of winter more humor.

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. I remember 

**Ben Walker:** one of the best compliments. Oh, sorry. No, sorry. Go ahead. The best compliments I ever got at a convention was people who were at PAX and could do anything they wanted to PACS would go through the library because it was part of the demo scene and read every single book title and be like, ah, nice.

That's great. If you'd rather read our book titles and do it, you know, whatever you want to do at PAX. 

**Jonas Rosland:** Yeah. Yeah. I love that. So let's let's dive into the game itself. I'm gonna switch screens here and see if we can do some artwork. Yeah. [00:30:00] So I want to first start with some of the characters that we have of the game, but actually, no, let's start with the game.

Explain the game. What is it about

**Kyla Fury:** who's best for those whose most recently done the elevator pitch for it?

I'll do the elevator pitch for it. The elevator pitch for it is you are students from a tabletop gaming club in a small Northeastern boarding school in 1981. You're a bunch of nerds. The only place you fit in is at this club. And then one day the principal announces that the entire school and all its clubs is going to be involved in this giant snowball tournament and the clubs have to compete with each other.

And if you lose or you refuse to participate, your club is just disbanded forever because he's trying to narrow it down to find some kind of ultimate club. And so the game [00:31:00] is about trying to survive the club, using the tactics that you learned from your tabletop gaming to apply to these snowball fights that you have to do.

And also it's about like reaching out to other clubs that have been disbanded and, you know, learning about people and making friends and, you know, saving the world with the power of friendship and imagination. Like all good stories. 

**Ryan Anderson:** I 

**Jonas Rosland:** love it. And we see some of the main characters here as well. So let's dive into the characters.

There we go. So here's our first character who is this? 

**Kyla Fury:** This is Alicia. Alicia is in a lot of ways. Me as a teen girl, she's like nerdy and she loves reading books about like empowering female protagonists. And she really likes tabletop games. She is also not me in a lot of ways because she is very like shy and avoids confrontation.

Which was absolutely not me in [00:32:00] high school, but 

**Ben Walker:** he's also the player character and she wants to be a writer when she grows up. So you get to do a lot of writing scenes with her, where you write tabletop 

**Ryan Anderson:** campaigns. Yeah. And that was definitely one of the more exciting features that we all collaborated on.

We, we scaled back a lot of it for a lot of reasons. But yeah, we ended up with a bunch of stuff in the battles actually being reflecting what you choose during these kind of multiple choice, creative writing, like Madlibs sequences, where you, you know, like the kind of like theming that a certain enemy would have, what determines.

Like what it would look like and what it would be named a lot of the times, or you could have a recurring villain or choose to just drop it off and create new villains and stuff. And I think we even have an achievement for, if you keep bringing back the villain from the the first one of the rarest one 

**Kyla Fury:** recurring villain four times.

**Ryan Anderson:** I do actually think that that's probably a good [00:33:00] thing though, that, that one's so rare because it means that people actually wanted to like try out different character designs as opposed to just like, yeah. But, you know, if you're, if you're that kind of DM, which I actually was when I was in high school of just like, I love like, like Mr.

Seymour and final fantasy, 10 of just like that, just obnoxious boss that you fight in so many different forms. If he just keeps coming back you can actually do it in this one. 

**Kyla Fury:** And we, we would say a lot sort of during the dev process that Alicia's superpower is her empathy. So like her, you know, her whole thing is about being the one who like, can reach out to other people and cares about other people and cares that they're doing okay.

You know, which is, it's a, it's a tough stretch for her because she is one of like only two black girls at her entire school. And so she has a lot of problems with feeling isolated and sort of lonely. And you know, this tabletop club is like the place where she can fit in and find something. That helps her [00:34:00] belong.

And so she shares that by reaching out to others. And we wanted to kind of give the player that feeling of like, you know, reaching out and trying to think about, you know, these, these other characters that you bring in and how that, you know, how that feels and how can we do that mechanically. And so I think it was Mike who had the idea of like, well, rather than us writing a story, that's like this, this part partly also came from we wanted to write like, okay, she's going to write these stories for these new characters.

And it's going to be a metaphor for the characters problems, Allah, you know, persona four. And they play through the tabletop, you know, game to address the characters problems. And Ben, I think was like, I don't think people get subtlety and like metaphor. Like we may have to, we may have to be a little more blatant.

And so Mike had this idea of like, well, what if we force the player to write the metaphor? Right? Like what if the way we explain the metaphor is the player picks the metaphor, right? Where Alicia says, you know, like this person is like really [00:35:00] shy. So I need an excuse for him to reach out to people. What would be a good reason for him to reach out?

And then we give you like four metaphors and you choose the one that, you know, applies to that. And then it impacts the combat side, right? Like it affects the mechanics. So you're like, I think this is the coolest villain for the person to face. And then like that becomes in the mechanics who the villain is and like what their powers are.

And so, you know, Alicia's, Alicia's empathy was kind of. The, the writing character concept around which a lot of the mechanics in the game were designed. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Although it was something that we didn't want to weigh down with a lot of like rules, baggage, or like extra text or explanation, but we didn't want people to feel like they were going in blind.

So we did end up scaling back a lot of it to just be kind of aesthetic, like when it came to the combat and focused on like the narrative. So it's 

**Kyla Fury:** kind of, 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah, so for bathroom, that's a main storyline. That one, [00:36:00] the like one of the, yeah, I think the final battle that she doesn't hurt 

**Kyla Fury:** pain. Her final boss, I think Duncan's final boss, right?

Like their mechanics. Cause there's like the one that's like a spider that gives birth the baby spiders or whatever. Yeah. That's a mechanical 

**Ben Walker:** thing. Investment has a portal 

**Ryan Anderson:** like bapa Mets, it's like base, you get to pick like the way that the portal is being held open and that determines like, do you fight to like powerful mobs?

Do you have to clear out a bunch of little ones? But that one, it was like the alternate objective fight and whatever alternate objective you had was determined by the campaign. But yeah, I think ultimately it was probably the right call to scale back a lot of the real stuff. As like cools the gimmick might be but 

**Kyla Fury:** you also worked really hard when we were designing side quest stuff, to make sure that.

We, so we have this thing where you, you gain upgrades in the game by like reaching out to other people on the campus and a lot of them like members of your team. And so I know you, like, you did a [00:37:00] lot of work to make sure that like, the upgrades that you unlock by talking to this person are the upgrades that work better with that person in combat, so that it makes you stronger, like as a pair to fight with that person.

Yeah. I 

**Ryan Anderson:** could, I could definitely like probably later if I'm talking about like combat and progression and everything, but I'll definitely elaborate a lot more on that. Once, once we're more focused on combat, that sounds great. Cause yeah, there there's a lot of interesting stuff with the combat and specifically how it was like supporting the story.

Mostly cause like I came on pretty late in the project. A lot of stuff was pretty established by that point. And my main kind of role was like coming in, evaluating the combat and you know, working off playtest feedback and working with everybody else on the team to try and like really make the combat more supportive of the story and everything.

As, you know, as opposed to being really focused on it being like a hardcore like mechanical game or anything. Yeah. 

**Jonas Rosland:** Awesome. Yeah. [00:38:00] We'll, we'll, we'll dive into that in a bit. So let's go to the next character that we have. 

**Kyla Fury:** Colin. I feel like there's a, there's a problem in a lot of video games where you can't give your main character an arc because they're the player character and you kind of always have to like them, right?

Like you, you, you want the player to emphasize with the character that they're controlling. And usually when you don't, it like makes for some weird dissonance, like I can think of Catherine is a game where like, you hate the player character and it's like, it's, it makes for a weird experience. And because of this, a lot of games do a thing where like the villain gets the arc instead.

And I kind of think Collin fell into that a little bit. So Colin is the founder of the club. He's the, like the character that, you know, cares the most about tactics and like really feels, you know, has very strong opinions about the rules and how the game works. And what's good and what's [00:39:00] bad in there.

And he's like, because of this, he, you know, like our game is a lot about the idea of identity and like why you shouldn't. Build your entire identity on one single thing. And Colin's problem is he's kind of built his entire identity around this club. And so when new people start coming in, he starts to feel like threatened and defensive and spoilers for our game.

But there's also like, you know, and a powerful, evil, magical force like that, that blows up these feelings and, you know, and makes them worse and, and kind of forces you to fall into these, these mental traps of paranoia and defensiveness isolation. And so, you know, our, our, the colon kind of gets the arc in like S the, the point of the game being like gatekeeping is bad.

And so, like, Collins, you know, is a well-meaning guy, but he's kind of a gatekeeper. And he gets sort of like worse and [00:40:00] worse over the course of the game until there's like a final confrontation in the end where you have to be like, Colin, remember, like, you are more than this club. Like, it's not, you are not all like only tactics.

You are a person who has depth and who can do other things, and you need to like chill out. And so, you know, you, you rescue him from the evil influence and he kind of like, you know, it occurs to him like, shoot, I've been. Being kind of a terrible person to everyone else in this club. And I really need to like work on myself and be better about that.

**Jonas Rosland:** It sounds like this is a real life lesson as well, that a lot of people will experience I guess because it's easy, especially as a teenager to kind of tie yourself and tie your identity to another group of people that are like you. So I definitely liked 

**Ryan Anderson:** that metaphor here too. 

**Ben Walker:** Amer gate in the old right slash all were happening while we were creating this game.

You know, can you kinda, 

**Kyla Fury:** sorry, I [00:41:00] just swallowed some water the wrong way. 

**Ben Walker:** And part of the moral we wanted to teach about your more than your club, kind of, we felt like a gain special emphasis, and we were shaped by seeing Gamergate and seeing these people who were so associated with this idea of being a, sort of, you know, a hardcore gamer who is rude to other people.

And I'm sure you're familiar with the Gamergate type. We wanted to give them a non didactic and non not judgemental feeling way to say here is where you are wrong and here is what you should do to right yourself. 

**Ryan Anderson:** I like that. 

**Kyla Fury:** And we, it was, it was super interesting because the, the very like original idea when Mike and I first came on was this was going to be like a pretty traditional underdog sports movie type narrative, where it's like the geeky nerdy club against everyone else and defeating the popular kids.

And then like the more we sort of looked around at the modern landscape, we were like, actually, the problem is like, everyone [00:42:00] thinks they're the underdog. And they use that to justify treating everyone else, like garbage, because they think like, well, we're the good ones who like, are persecuted and, you know, like everyone else is against us.

And we're like, actually that attitude is kind of what the problem is. So like that attitude is going to be our villain. And then, you know, the game will culminate around, like beating that idea. 

**Jonas Rosland:** So I'm talking about underdogs. We have our third character here as well. Jacob, 

**Kyla Fury:** yeah, a lot of people's favorite character.

I think based on what I've seen is for streamers, 

**Ryan Anderson:** when that wasn't in the, the demo version that I played when I was interviewing for this. But Jacob was an immediate draw for me as the character, I think like in my interview, like the first thing and like the biggest thing that I just kept being annoying about was like, he's like tagging a wall early on.

And at least in the version that like I played as part of the [00:43:00] test. Nothing happened to based on you answering what tag you should do. And it, it kept me up at night. Like I was, it drove me insane. And like so much of yeah, what ended up being like really evocative for people in winter more and stuff and stuff that I've, I think we should all be very proud of, like adding in to like the story was having that kind of cause and effect where like the, the choices you make, even if it's just an aesthetic thing or anything kind of carry on throughout.

And yeah, so we ended up with not only the spray paint, actually getting filled out with what you put, but there was a whole side quest thing later on where someone vandalizes his vandalism and he gets really upset about it and that it's, it's just extremely cute. Like they tried to make his like winter Morris fascist like message into something wholesome.

**Ben Walker:** So it became winter more is fast-growing 

**Ryan Anderson:** fascinating. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So it was originally going to be like, winter more [00:44:00] is fast becoming like a world, like a, you know, a leading school or something like that, but that was too long for the wall. So yeah, whatever you choose with Jacob depends.

So it's like you, because if you say winter more is hell it becomes winter more is hello. If you do winter more as fascist, it becomes much more as fascinating. If you do. Winter more is lame. It becomes a winter more is blameless, which is maybe the most ominous. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. Especially with the whole, like the principal is trying to get you to like fight against your friends and like devolve your social circle.

**Kyla Fury:** What's the what's but yeah, we should probably talk, 

**Ben Walker:** go ahead. Yeah. Like who Jacob is, it's kind of a comic relief character. So when we first created the core trio of Alicia, Collin, and Jacob, it was driven by this idea that there is a sort of almost a youngian archetype of a trio, I guess, to drop it like $10 phrase and the conversation that you see [00:45:00] in a bunch of Disney movies and also like Steven universe and the main character, the one that's supposed to be the player stand in is usually a fairly average shaped human being.

And then there is a tall gangly character who's comic relief and who kind of is goofy. And that was just like a very big character who is the leader of a group. So you see this in like Steven universe and you see this in, they just did it in Ray in the last dragon, which I just watched over the weekend.

And. We created our three character archetypes based on that. So Alicia is the most average, you know, shaped character. And she's the player standing. Collin is the big leader character who also wound up being our villain. And Jacob is the goofy gangly comic relief character. He is, he wouldn't be a stoner if our game talked about weed, but our game does not talk about weed.

He is, you know, 

**Kyla Fury:** he's political. He has a P S P a political ideology. No one knows exactly what it is, but he has one 

**Ryan Anderson:** it's [00:46:00] political ideology 

**Ben Walker:** is he's discovered the names of all the politicians that make us history, teachers grown and roll their eyes and he just shuts them out. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah, he's he's contrarian.

And kind of like like he, he causes chaos or like, and he, and he ties it to like this idea, like this vague ideology, but it's just like a justification for, he just wants to act out, you know? And it's, it's ultimately like he he's that very typical kind of person who is resisting actually growing up by finding a way to justify childishness.

Grown-up words a lot of the time I feel. Yeah. And he's very relatable to anyone who went through a complaint on the internet about leftist issues too much phase while not actually doing things 

**Ben Walker:** in his Twitter tag nowadays. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. He's also, he's also very privileged. Like we get into it and one of the side stories, but like, he comes from a very wealthy [00:47:00] family and they like donate a lot to the school, which kind of protects him from getting kicked out.

And he's like aware of that, this privilege, but also rebelling against it because he like recognizes that it's unfair. So he's sort of one of those, like, you know, he calls himself a punk, but he kind of doesn't actually have that much punk cred. Like a great 

**Ben Walker:** side question about 

**Ryan Anderson:** that. Yeah. Oh, I guess just side note, this would probably be labeled with like yeah.

Massive spoilers for story and stuff in the game. 

**Jonas Rosland:** I'll make sure to tag this as spoiler Aish or 

spoiler. 

**Ryan Anderson:** I, yeah, I don't, I don't want to like, hold back on talking about actually like useful information if, just because of spoilers. So 

**Kyla Fury:** yeah. But yeah, Jacob. I feel like he's based on a sort of person that a lot of people knew in high school, right?

Like or worse. Yeah. That's I feel like we get, we get half and half of that when I watch streamers, like half of the people go, like [00:48:00] I knew that guy in high school and half of the people go, like I was that guy in high school. But you know, he's like, he's ultimately well-meaning he cares about his friends.

He's just also kind of like, you know, a burnout. Like he doesn't really care that much about doing things. He just, he named, he named his his CNC character rogues, Pierre Troskey Guevara because yeah, because originally he just named the character Rogie and because he's lazy and his character was a rogue and then retroactively he's like, actually let me pick these like political leaders from the past who've led revolutions.

And we actually got called out on that, I think on our steam page where someone's like, you know, these are like, like horrible people in some cases. Right. And we're like, listen, Jacob didn't think very deeply about this. Like Jacob, Jacob likes revolutions. He doesn't really care much [00:49:00] about the meaning behind the revolutions.

And so you know, he's,

**Ben Walker:** David was part of CNC. Whereas let's just part of CNC because she loves fantasy worlds and colonists because he loves both fantasy worlds and roles. Jacob is part of CNC, I think simply because it is counter-culture at the time. And so we can see every character's fantasy version of themselves kind of reflects what they care about.

So Alicia has, you know, this very dramatic fantasy costumes, so does Collin, but Jacob's fantasy costume is kind of a joke referencing. This is basically just his hoodie. Again, 

**Kyla Fury:** I think it's with a Cape tied on a sheet, tied on as a Cape. It's 

**Ben Walker:** really just enough to be counterculture in any way that he can, rather than like the classic reasons to be playing D and D 

**Ryan Anderson:** and yeah, for any infants that are currently engaging with this during the eighties and like early nineties is everything there is kind of a satanic panic thing going on.[00:50:00] 

It definitely revolved a lot around like like homophobia and queer issues as well. But like, there was also a corner of it where it was very focused on specifically tabletop gaming mainly Dungeons and dragons and magic. The gathering were both like I even, like I was in elementary school in like the mid nineties.

And there were still parents who like, would not lit kids interact with me, like their children interact with me because I played magic the gathering and they were worried about. I was at which that would summon demons and possess them. So it was like a only 

**Jonas Rosland:** if you have the right cards. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. Oh, you know, now that's Yu-Gi-Oh.

But as the yeah, it's one of those, like in, in that era, even though it was like pretty like nerdy thing and like, it did have that like kind of basement, dweller association and everything. It also was a kind of like weird counterculture and something that like conservative America at the time, it was very like Pearl clutchy over, 

**Kyla Fury:** there was [00:51:00] one case.

And like, I don't actually know the history very well, so this could be entirely apocryphal, but there was like one case where some kid like committed suicide and they found out that he had been in D and D and there was like, it was blown up into this. Like they think they're really they're characters.

And if the character dies, they have to kill themselves. And it's a cult where they're, you know, obsessed with these demons and like dark fantasy. It 

**Ryan Anderson:** was, it was that like Momo thing, but for boomers. Yeah. Like the, the like weird chicken lady thing where like everyone was in a panic over a couple of years back.

Yeah. Yeah, Dungeons and dragons. So yeah, there's definitely a little bit like a few kind of references to that. Like making them outsiders more than it being like a nerdy thing. But yeah, that might be a little lost on people who are kind of used to it being like really common. Like everyone's got a podcast where they're just playing D and D and [00:52:00] recording themselves, you know 

**Kyla Fury:** stuff like that.

There's a, there's a line we have about that in the, the assembly scene early on, where one of the dialogue choices is Alicia says like, do they, you, they're asking, why were we brought into this assembly? And one of the dialogue traces is, do they think we're doing devil stuff and not con yeah. Colin says God, I've explained to my mom a thousand times, it's a tactical storytelling board game, not devil 

**Ryan Anderson:** stuff.

Yeah. It's like that. And then all the new wave music club references are probably like the most dated references we make. Like we tried to make it kind of a, like, it's about like modern internet culture, but just not set in the internet kind of game. But yeah, there's definitely, I think those two big things if you don't know the context for them, might've gone over some heads.

**Ben Walker:** Shout out to our writer, Mike, who wrote all the new wave music references because he is a gigantic music nerd and he wrote them all [00:53:00] without any reference. Like he just knew off the top of his head who the lead singer was, where for every band. 

**Kyla Fury:** I don't think that's true. I think he did do some research.

He does know a lot of music, nerd stuff. 

**Ryan Anderson:** But if you're, if you're saving anything for transcripts, make sure you say he had the uncanny ability to have all those references in his head. I think that sounds cooler. It's in the written transcripts now. Excellent. 

**Jonas Rosland:** So let's dive in, dive into the the final character here that you have in your, in your press kit, which is the principal.

Who is this 

**Ryan Anderson:** Gary Gygax? 

**Kyla Fury:** No, it's Gary, Gygax his friend, basically. Very 

**Ben Walker:** bit of lower explaining that he knows Gary Gygax. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. Did that, should we, should we start by explaining mustache adult? Like originally there, this, this character, this is one of the characters that actually changed design because like [00:54:00] Colin, Alicia and Jacob were built at the beginning by the artist and like Mike and I inherited them and we just use them.

And there was a principal character originally in that one too, but he was kind of like this much bigger guy with like a big fancy mustache. And we. He, the original idea was he was going to be a beatnik because the original plot of the story was that like beatniks were going to be sucking out like the life energy from the students.

Because there was this whole weird co in beatnik culture, there was this like weird concept of like psychic energy that they had. And Ryan's giving me this, like, what the fuck? 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. This was like, Yeah, very cool. I would have probably hesitated a lot more joined this game. 

**Kyla Fury:** energy. Yeah. So they, they were, he was going to be like this V Nick, who is siphoning Oregon energy from the the [00:55:00] students.

And we did it. We did actually go pretty far down the like researching beatnik culture, like rabbit hole. And then, then the story changed to like actually being about internet culture. And we're like, all right, we gotta do something different for, for the principal for principal Enfield. So instead of being a burnt out beatnik or like a current beatnik, he became this like burnt out hippie who had been like, all about the like peace and love movement back in the sixties.

But like now it's the eighties and he's, you know, got a real job and he's, you know, like he's had kind of a rough time. He had a falling out, he was part of the spoilers, again, part of the original group that invented the tabletop game CNC, but due to various reasons, they had a falling out. And so he's like not part of that anymore.

And he's, he's based on a number of things, but one of them is the buddy Christ from the dogma movie. Who's like, Hey so he does that pose whenever he's like, he's like trying to be like upbeat and positive about [00:56:00] things like, Hey, this tournament's about positive vibes and togetherness and like show your school spirit.

**Ben Walker:** And it's very, it's very skin deep that part of him, 

**Jonas Rosland:** th that, that specific part, because I I've noticed that as as I've been playing, he's like, yeah, this is, this is going to be super fun. And although the peace signs are flowing out out of em, and I get this really strong dang Enron puffy, it feel where it's like, no, what you're saying is terrible.

Your gestures do not justify what you're saying. This is, this is not good. And I, I love that kind of juxtaposition of what he's saying and what he's doing 

**Ryan Anderson:** that conflict and that kind of weirdness and like the way that kind of unsettled people who first engage with it and just doesn't make sense from a writing.

It's, it's kind of like the way people get led into the mystery, [00:57:00] you know, it's, it's like a, it's almost like w one thing I really appreciate about kind of like the way this story leads into the mystery is I feel like some of the best kind of like mystery stories are ones where, like the premise kind of slowly unravels in the background is they start by just introducing, like, imagine like a plank of wood where someone has like, created a little splinter that is just sticking.

And like the player is just like running their hand over it over and over again. And it's perfectly smooth. Normally it's for this one little splinter that just like feels wrong when you're touching it and stuff. And like that entices them to start digging at it. And eventually like pulling that apart and finding what's underneath and everything.

And yeah. So it's interesting seeing people kind of evolve from like, why is this guy like this? And like, this doesn't make sense to oh as like they learn more important things throughout the storylines 

**Kyla Fury:** has his own motivations. Like he, he's putting, he's trying to put a happy face on some things, but like his, his brain space [00:58:00] is deep and mysterious.

**Ryan Anderson:** And yeah, if you've been like, if you've been a student for a like an underfunded kind of academic department or something, and you have someone who really genuinely cares at like the head of that department, constantly having to let you down and that kind of desperation as he's like delivering bad news, but not wanting like the students to revolt.

Like he definitely kind of has those vibes a lot of the time. Like he doesn't. Really necessarily want to be doing this to everybody, but he's just trying to put on a happy, 

**Kyla Fury:** he like moves the spirit week up six months in the calendar to try and have like a positive school vibes event to cheer everything up.

**Ryan Anderson:** It accidentally just becomes very dystopian because everyone has to like make propaganda posters about how you don't really need clubs. And it's actually okay that this is happening. So yeah, that kind of like eeriness and juxtaposition was one of the few places where it kind of broke away from like the comfort that the [00:59:00] game tries to like really drive home.

But in order to like create something that stood out and drew people kind of deeper into like the mystery. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. If you, if it's not clear by now, Mike and I are very big on absurdism as sort of, you know, a sense of humor. And so basically like one of our most common strategies in our writing was like to take a semi realistic thing and then just like turn the volume all the way up on it, like way, way too much dumb until it became super ridiculous.

**Ryan Anderson:** So 

**Jonas Rosland:** speaking of close to reality, we got the the three main characters also have these end game characters. So you want to talk a little about about these? 

**Kyla Fury:** Sure. Yeah. So this is Ann Jaya who is elite. Major character. I feel like Ryan should talk the most about the end game characters because they're more characterized by their mechanics than they are by by their dialogue for the most part.

**Ryan Anderson:** Good. Yeah. I know [01:00:00] the end game characters were really interesting challenge as a combat designer because it wasn't just, you know, I need to check off boxes for certain roles or represent certain mechanics. The characters had to not only, you know, fill those roles and fit together as a team, which there ends up being seven total characters.

But you can run three at a time. The but yeah, in addition to just filling the roles that a normal party of characters normally has to, they also have to each kind of feel like that character's personality and fit into you know, the character that's represented in the story. So it doesn't feel weird that like they really change up their personality when they go into the CNC, especially since like so much of the story revolves around Leisha is trying to like meet people where they are and create characters in the story that make them feel comfortable joining CNC, which is actually, you know, a source of a big conflict with her and Colin because he's the big rules lawyer.

And there's actually, there's a few lines of dialogue [01:01:00] that Colin has that are literally just lifted from like me complaining about shit and chat. And oh wait, sorry. I did a swear. That's perfectly fine. Okay. A bad habit from working in salty workplaces. But the yeah, so like I think one of my favorite ones bits of dialogue was li like the last character that you recruit.

He like is a member of the basically the furry club and his character is a specific kind of fruit bat and a very specific kind according to the writers. So I initially, when I was pitching this character and had to come up with someone that like matched that personality I was like, oh, cool.

Yeah. I guess like, you know, there's a few options we have, we could do like like kind of vampiric, like tank but has to be high aggression sort of character with like blood draining attacks. And they're like, oh no, this is a fruit bat. Only, only three. I thought it was, I 

**Kyla Fury:** thought it was funny. Cause we were like, well, like, you [01:02:00] know, it makes sense.

Vampirism or like echo, cause we're trying to come up with a flying character and we were like, well, we don't want to do bird. So what about bat? And you, you kept like coming up with cool bat mechanics and I'm like what Sonic attacks 

**Ryan Anderson:** like an, a whole echolocation kind of like mark your target system. 

**Kyla Fury:** If we picked up that, that like can't do any traditional bats, none 

**Ryan Anderson:** of the normal game design tropes for bats.

Like so no Sonic attacks and like in, in game they actually have this back and forth when they're trying to come up with this character. And then like, so they gave me the, the specific name. Oh yeah. So I've mentioned echolocation and the bat is not blind sees perfectly fine. And there was so I, I basically like looked up like the bat, like breed on Wikipedia and like the main thing it was known for, was it eating fruit and then shitting out the seeds for soil.

And there's a whole thing of like their like main [01:03:00] socialization was oral sex, which like obviously monitoring for this game. And I didn't even want to like attempt to make combat mechanics around that. So, oh yeah. And then sometimes it might be, yeah, exactly. So yeah, there was a kind of like plagued bite Malay mechanic ended up being, since it was the seventh character.

I kind of had three characters that focused on physical damage, three on magical damage. And then this was kind of the character that could fit into all of your existing kits, because you had so few battles to like work with them. I wanted to make that character basically a viable option regardless of what you were doing at that point.

So it was very flexible character ended up being kind of a summoner Druid character with a high mobility. But yeah, there's a full-on dialogue back and forth where a Duncan is excitedly explaining that facts to call, but yes, 

**Kyla Fury:** Jaya's mechanics, right? 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. So anyway, and J and J is rad. And Jack is she, she's kind of like, you know, being the main [01:04:00] protagonist character.

I wanted her to have like the flashiest kind of marquee mechanic which in this game is a chain lightening effects. There's a bunch of mechanics that revolve around chaining. And the biggest thing for angina is she's very. She's a very supportive kind of leader. She's the kind of manager that would make sure that everyone on her team signs a way more than trying to like, be domineering over them or be the person that like gets the spotlight.

So her, her main mechanic, cause she's kind of like the glass cannon ranged AOE character or area of effect, attack character. But she needs other characters to kind of support her and line up attacks to really shine the most. And I felt that was like, she also is with her upgrades.

She's the one that gets a lot of abilities that give you additional tactics points or give buffs to other characters. So she she's very good at encouraging other players. And and the like 

**Ben Walker:** she's a major like the D and [01:05:00] D E K classes were major warrior and rogue. So the three main characters are a major warrior and a 

**Ryan Anderson:** rogue.

Yeah. And 

**Kyla Fury:** fudged Collins class. He's like some kind of weird hybrid between a Paladin and a barbarian, but a warrior it's, it's slightly different in CNC. CNC is like meaner mirror university in D 

**Ryan Anderson:** so yeah, there's like the magical girl. There's there's the punchy boy. And then there's the, the Trixie one.

I was like the generic archetypes and then the other characters were kind of elaborations on each of the previous characters. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah, and I, I got to say chain lightening is my favorite mechanic to use in the game. Like every time I had to do like play through stuff, it's all about like, let's see how much of the battlefield we can connect into one single contiguous chain.

So I can get everybody at once with chain lightning, just kind of what 

**Ryan Anderson:** I 

**Jonas Rosland:** was having a lot of fun with that mechanic as well, just to use the [01:06:00] grappling hook. So early on in the game, when you get the grappling hook and just started started using that and making sure that I pushed and pulled people into small piles.

So I could use the, the chain mechanic there, the chain lightening mechanic, it's just, just feels so good to just to nuke a ton of enemies at the same time, 

**Ryan Anderson:** my original background, like being heavily in like designing mechanics for puzzle games and like different puzzles meant that because of this game was fully deterministic.

And we, we didn't have any randomness and everything. We a lot of the battles were just naturally going to have a puzzle, like solution and everything. And I. One of our core and really like obvious mechanics to feel like this kind of emergent puzzle that you got to play around with, depending on like the team comp that you set up, like, are you using the psycho master class that comes along later that actually creates mist that conducts the electricity and connects, you know, groups of enemies or like you using like the grappling hook or the shove reposition stuff?

Yeah. Rogie is, you know, [01:07:00] whole personality. He really likes throwing wrenches and other people's plans, disrupting things and everything. So I went with a heavy like reposition focus for his kit. And I believe chaining came out of like a conversation at GDC with an into the breech dev where like the, the main, like really great advice and takeaway I got from that was having, having kind of like a flashy and fun mechanic that gives people, like goals to work towards, like that are apart from just grind your opponent's health to nothing is something that feels very, very good.

And I was definitely like, chaining was always in the game and everything, but it was very sparingly used. It was like, I was very afraid of it because of how powerful it seems. And I was afraid of making something seem too good. And there's just, there's definitely a point where it's just like, but it's fun.

And like, ultimately [01:08:00] like you know, with like certain enemy types and a few more things that we added into the game, like the magical versus physical damage and everything made chaining a lot more fair. And a lot of the other stuff, a lot more viable, but yeah, it ended up being pretty okay. That, you know, there's a very obvious and loud kind of keyword mechanic that makes people feel good about building around.

Especially since this was men as like a kind of introduction to the genre. I really wanted players to kind of understood or understand what is really fun for, for me with this kind of genre, but on a very like boiled down in very kind of obvious level. But yeah, I want 

**Jonas Rosland:** to dive into the the other two focused character serious as well here as well.

So this is Collins persona. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah, so he's, he's got like big 10 character. He has the best stats sorta reflect his men, maxi rules, lawyer nature. And because he was kind of a villain I kind [01:09:00] of. AOL ad well

I let him kind of eat being the like, boring, but like very easy to use kind of like a supportive tank character. It's, you know, he's probably the hardest to lose fights with, but probably one of the worst for like, you know, he has the lowest ceiling as far as like what he can pull off and everything and like, yeah, overall mechanically, he kind of ended up not being super popular from feedback I got, but like, I was pretty okay with that because like, he also, like story-wise a lot of people just didn't like using them cause they thought he was a jerk.

And if there was an, he does fill a very important role. Like he has a lot of really great supportive abilities that are heavily designed around. If a player is struggling with certain concepts that are difficult in our core system, like the the way enemies, target other people, if you paid close attention to that, you can just, the repositioning completely avoid getting hit in most battles.

If you're smart about your [01:10:00] positioning or unit take out the right enemy and then create the safe spot. Hailed Wald kind of makes up for, if you don't know how to do that well, or you find yourself cornered in everything, by being able to taunt enemies or to hit them with a crowd control effect that reduces the damage they deal.

So yeah, so he, he kind of he, his main role was kind of being kind of like the rock the, the high stats character and the one, the one that wins battles, basically, no matter what just to like kind of reflect who he would be as a CNC player. 

**Kyla Fury:** He also like as a character, he thinks about himself as like the leader who takes care of the rest of the club and protects them and like, you know, stands up to bullies and doesn't, you know, get, get rattled by them and stuff.

So that's kind of reflected in, you know, he's this stoic pallet and character that can taunt damage away from the rest of the party and take it on himself and, you know, sort of martyr himself. He can take [01:11:00] 

**Ryan Anderson:** his arc and yeah, he's he also is one of the only characters that just starts with like flat physical armor.

So like the physical attacks hitting him, actually do, you know, end up being less efficient than if they were hitting any other player. In addition to him just being meteor health wise. 

**Jonas Rosland:** So our our final or our third character here, Jacob, 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. Yeah. 

**Jonas Rosland:** What's his full name 

**Ryan Anderson:** again? 

**Kyla Fury:** Rugs. PR Trotsky.

Guevara. I love it. Okay. Yeah, Rogie or as one article about winter more erroneously put it it's pronounced Roca guy, which should not pronounced rogue guy, but

**Ryan Anderson:** you got to love when people speak of on like, like with authority about your game and are just like very wrong. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. ROCI you can tell from [01:12:00] Rogies attire that like, he's not Jacob, doesn't take the game, like super seriously. 

**Jonas Rosland:** He has a bandana. He has a little what do you call it? Cape Cape ish and yeah, his outfit is, has done.

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. But like mechanically I already mentioned, you know, he really likes disrupting plans, like mixing things up and everything. And then also kind of as a CNC player focused him a bit on like how I am when I'm a player and not a DM, which is, you'd think I'd have more empathy for DMS. Because that's like, that was like the first role I kind of did when I was like playing it in high school.

But now as a player. A huge troll. I I'm a, just a problem. I'm, I'm usually like I pick my abilities based on what's going to create weird emergent situations, everything. So he's the kind of character who would demand a grappling hook and then find all [01:13:00] sorts of annoying ways to use it that make like the DM, like have to like rub their temple and be like, no, yeah, that works.

And like, like 

**Kyla Fury:** with it, because he's known Jacob for like years and years and years, but he's not like thrilled with 

**Ryan Anderson:** it. And kind of how that's reflected in gameplay is he has a lot of stuff where he, he, he lines up like really perfect moments with his reposition mechanics and everything. And he has a lot of, he's definitely got some of the most flexible abilities because all of his reposition mechanics can also target friendlies without dealing damage to them.

So, you know, he has the ability to pull and GY out of danger or even across little rivers, which forces enemies to path across like large areas. And yeah, so making people feel clever and also like they're kind of getting one over on the game and potentially even like choosing the game was actually part of Robbie's character because.

How he would actually play, you know, CNC as a person. 

**Kyla Fury:** [01:14:00] Yeah. Also Jacob loves like action movies. He's very into like, you know, like big showy, dramatic flashy kind of action. And so this is, you know, that character sort of reflects that showiness in a, he just wants the thing that will make his, like, that will seem cool in the moment.

I think there's an upgrade that you can get him for Christmas that's like background music that like plays when he makes an entrance. And and one of the other characters is like, you know, it's maybe not the best idea for the rogue to have like showy background music. They enter a room. Think of like, I'll make it work.

It's fun. 

**Ryan Anderson:** I think people were so upset, like especially hardcore tactics players, like cons were very, very upset that he did not deal additional damage from attacking enemies from behind through the face, 

**Ben Walker:** actually the attack from behind. Yeah. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. Like, oh yeah. Sorry. [01:15:00] Yeah. It's that was one of the major, like kind of genre conventions, because you know, like facing direction and is like an element of positioning.

That's very common and you know, turn-based tactics games you know, final fantasy tactics, like just like a lot of games care. If someone is facing the other way for like chance to hit or like. Chance to crit getting bonuses and everything, and especially the rogue character. But he ended up kind of like focusing more on like Rogue's being flexible, Jack of all trades kind of characters and very like having a lot of situational tools for specific situations that I think honestly is a lot more accurate to what D and D or CNC rogues would do.

Then like like just sneak and sneak attack, you know, apart from like, that is the way they deal damage and everything, but, you know, it like it was something that we did intentionally drop knowing it would be controversial because it didn't really contribute to the actual enjoyment of the genre.

And it [01:16:00] adds a lot of rules, baggage, which would be good if we were trying to create a much longer game that needed more content or a more hardcore game. But like for this game, it didn't need the extra upgrades. It didn't need the nuance that already had plenty of mechanics. And it was just like a lot of weird invisible rules.

And that was also another big thing we wanted to avoid. Ben had an immediate, like from the get-go, like, you should be able to look at the board and like have an idea of what is going on kind of rural from, 

**Ben Walker:** into the breach actually into the breach has an amazing thing, which is you can post a screenshot of, into the breach on your forums and be like help.

How do I solve. And no information is needed about the screenshot. This screenshot contains everything you need to know. And we were aiming for that with the game. And, you know, I really liked the idea of a game being that simple, I think, into the breaches and amazingly designed game because of its simplicity.

And I felt like facing was just, it added too much [01:17:00] complexity for it's worth. And so even though we had facing implemented in the game and showed it off at some early demo builds, yeah. We just asked the whole system. 

**Jonas Rosland:** I was reading through some of the documents that you sent over prior to the conversation here.

And yeah, just as you noted there, simplicity was key. And is that because of the demographic that you wanted to target for this? So it would be an easy, an easy tactics game to get into for, for new players or what was the what was the motivation for, for the easiness instead of the grinding us 

**Ryan Anderson:** and 

**Ben Walker:** hesitation on the word easy 

**Ryan Anderson:** easy to understand, not easy to mask.

Yeah. You try a Yin's mastery challenge and get back to me on I, I used streamed myself doing that and I wiped on that five times because I refuse to use it. Build that I choose to fight with. And I then discovered like, oh no, I made this very hard. It's the hardest, it's the hardest optional battle in the game.

So [01:18:00] whatever, but, but I do think a lot of 

**Ben Walker:** people, oh, I think a lot of people, when they hear the phrase tactics RPG, the thing that comes immediately to mind is like final fantasy tactics and these sort of very dense rule books that required discussing on Ghana fake use to understand like even what the possibility space is.

And I was trying to move away from that in part, because I think like simpler is more aesthetically pleasing. And I look at a game like into the breach and I just see a various sightedly pleasing game that would give me pleasure to mimic. But also we knew fairly early on that we were targeting kind of the joke phrase to describe them internally was tumbler teens 13 year olds who are very interested in like video games and nerd stuff, and also social justice and maybe hanging out, hanging out on tumbler.

I'm sure you're familiar with this 

**Ryan Anderson:** concept, 

**Kyla Fury:** cozy cottage core stuff on tumbler and, and it's a, is it soft punk or kind punk that was the term for, it was circulating Tumblr for a while of like, [01:19:00] no, it's actually like really bad-ass to like be supportive of your friends and like have a positive attitude 

**Ryan Anderson:** to use more clinical and less potentially condescending terms.

It was. The visual novel crowd and people that were getting into those games and kind of propping up that whole scene. He 

**Kyla Fury:** cleared by the way that I am, I am one of those teams. And so I say this only with 

**Ryan Anderson:** love, but it was, it was mostly, yeah, at least like my impression was the visual novel crowd was the main focus for this game.

And we wanted to kind of make a game that was very welcoming to them and that kind of showed them what was fun about, you know, games that go a bit deeper with like combat and mechanics and everything. And like those RPGs so they could potentially, you know, it was kind of like an yeah, like a gateway game to, to like get people used to some of these mechanics or where the joy can be found.

Because I feel sometimes, [01:20:00] especially with all the rules and like upfront, you know, barriers to entry it can be difficult to see what's even enjoyable or to find the fun in those 

**Kyla Fury:** games. We were also making a game about, you know, how to not alienate people from your hobby, right? Like, 

**Ryan Anderson:** yeah. So we don't want to what the gameplay to like alienate people from the story.

**Kyla Fury:** We wanted to make a game where like, if you came for the story, because you love visual novels and you want to be empathetic and connect with these characters that. Game mechanics shouldn't stop you from achieving that goal, right? It shouldn't be just like, this is really hard. And if you can't do it too bad, you're not good enough to play the game.

Right? Like that's, that's a very harsh thing. And so we even implemented a system whereby like, if you lose a fight twice, there's a no fail mode. And there's like, no punishment for choosing it. You can just say, I want to put on a mode where my characters can't die, so I can just continue with the 

**Ryan Anderson:** story.

I, I [01:21:00] will note that as the combat designer internally, I was very salty about this at first and was very wrong. It's ultimately like, I, I will like it very consistently, like have been proven wrong. Cause it turns out you just don't use it. If you like, you want to like, like 

**Kyla Fury:** that. I don't really care about the mechanics and want to do it.

Don't turn on no fail. This is stressing me out too much. I just want to see what comes next. Turn on. No fail. And it's in everyone's house. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. And like, even the people that I like saw playing at with like no fail and everything, and even like really cranked up like player health, but like really crank down enemy health.

So they're killing everything in one head and stuff like that. Like they were still really enjoying specific combat mechanics, which is all I really cared about is that like people would find their team and like enjoy how they played off each other. So it was definitely like, yeah. Okay. 

**Ben Walker:** Am I worth mentioning Undertale too.

As like for the audience, we are targeting the exact same audience as [01:22:00] Undertale. We were trying to do kind of, you know, what Undertale did except, I mean, I don't think people consider Undertale schmuck, although Undertale was like a schmuck also, but we were trying to take a lot of the Undertale concepts and apply them to tactics.

RPGs. I 

**Ryan Anderson:** think many of 

**Kyla Fury:** them, I do know people who have been alienated by Undertale because it was too hard. Right. Who went like, like I am like an entire beginner to this genre and the storytelling is really cool and cute, but I can't do this mechanic and I can't finish the game. And like, that's so sad because it's such a wonderful game.

It's like, no, we play play that. We want you to see the whole story. The point is for you to see the whole story, 

**Ryan Anderson:** we 

**Ben Walker:** did have a requirement, no real time behaviors. Everything can be done with infinite waiting in order to make it easier for this 

**Ryan Anderson:** folks. And yeah, there's definitely an element of just like, yeah, I kind of like walking so hopefully other games can run, you know, or like, you know, like bringing, bringing people in and being willing to cut out like a lot of mechanical cruft and [01:23:00] everything specifically.

So like once someone has played winter more, maybe there'll be more willing to, you know, engage a bit more with like other games that they might've been intimidated by before. 

**Kyla Fury:** You know, pick out what are the most fun, core things about tactics, right? It's like finding a build that you feel like that feels good and fun and like powerful to use.

And it's feeling clever because you did some movements that like messed with the enemy AI and like got you an extra turn that you weren't supposed to have. And you know, like these, these little pieces and like let's make the game just about those like good feeling things and not about weapon triangles and facing, and like permadeath on characters and like all the other stuff that comes like with the hardcore end of the genre.

**Ryan Anderson:** And, you know, there's still like elements of like strategy and especially teamwork since so much of the game is about characters connecting. So like, oh, like almost every status effect is designed not to [01:24:00] benefit whoever uses it, but to benefit another character. So like the order in which you do things.

So there starts to be, you know, the options to do a lot more complex stuff and get those like fiddlier like little interactions and everything, but at the bare minimum we wanted the floor and the barriers to entry to be as low as possible. While, while still getting some room for like an interesting ceiling with stuff like chaining or like vulnerability and the armor.

**Jonas Rosland:** So I'm flipping through some of the, 

**Kyla Fury:** yeah, I was going to say that that's my favorite thing to watch is when they realize that they have to draw there, they're being called upon to draw a picture of a horse. That's hands down the best reaction that we get to any moment in the game where people go, wait, I have to draw this.

And then they proceed. And so many people have made so many, like wonderful little weird drawings in our little drawing mini game. I love it so much. 

**Ryan Anderson:** And yeah, as far as like [01:25:00] just little bits of gameplay and story that like paid off really, really well. This was another one similar to like the graffiti moment where like the player does something and it's like a throwaway thing early on and they don't think they're ever going to see it again.

And then it keeps coming up like various, like, like there's a couple of moments where the different drugs that you did actually get used in the like story and like main world and everything. 

**Kyla Fury:** I will give credit to to our artists, Leo for pretty much everything in this screenshot, like the weird funky sticker designs, the strange names on the markers, which are called a thicker boy and Marcie Chan and the, the, the eraser is Mr.

Mistake. And I think all of those are amazing jokes. And the Leo, I believe came up with all of them. So. 

**Jonas Rosland:** That's awesome. Yeah. So I'm showing some of the screenshots that we have here from the game. And I gotta say, I, I really like this part here when you finish a fight and you can see, I, I, I [01:26:00] do enjoy the, the par functionality here and that you can actually you can be a lot better than, than par and then you are, what is it?

Super dependence. Something. 

**Ryan Anderson:** I can't remember what the super savvy, there we go. They have a couple last. Yeah. So let a grading. Oh, that is so the devil 

**Ben Walker:** may cry pretty directly. 

**Ryan Anderson:** I love it. Yeah. Well, I think 

**Kyla Fury:** we changed the names of the actual words that they use, but yeah. Yeah. And this is another example of that like low floor, high ceiling mentality, right.

Where it's like, you just have to win the fight to win the fight, right? Like you just have to, usually the goal is like defeat all the enemies and like, that's usually not crazy hard, but if you want to get the triple S rank, you gotta think about the moves you're doing and like which characters you're using 

**Ryan Anderson:** and harder.

This system actually is very, very heavily driven by a score systems from bubble sheets. [01:27:00] Actually, which were like bubble shooters were like pretty simple like fairly like easy or like random number generated, focus puzzles to like clear. But there was a lot of weird, subtle mechanics where you could optimize score.

And that was kind of where we put in like high level play. It never really like those systems never really got used in a way that was very satisfying to me when I was working for like bigger companies, everything. So with this one the metal system was very much set to be like, if you figure out this combat and you play it optimally, and you actually like treat it, you know, it's a hardcore tactics game because that's like what you get out of these games.

Then there is a space where you will be graded based on that. And those metals also unlock a lot of the abilities that I wouldn't really want to introduce to players who were uncomfortable with the genre, but we'll kind of satisfy a lot of players who are like, oh, I wanted more from this game. One big example is most.[01:28:00] 

The kind of consumable mechanics, which is I have a, there's a whole set of power word abilities that happen. You can use once per battle. They give a buffer, a few turns and everything. And those are very advanced mechanics compared to many of the other base mechanics that you run into while playing through the game normally.

But if you're playing very well, you'll get access to the challenge battles sooner because those are unlocked by getting a certain number of medals. And then those challenged battles tend to unlock stuff that is a harder to use, but more focused on the ceiling as opposed to the floor for the game.

And I think that was a very good kind of compromise with like creating a space for people who love the story and everything, but they do, they play a lot of taxes games before and they do kind of need a bit more neat. It, with their character customization, like. We 

**Kyla Fury:** have this ethos that we tried to work in when we were thinking about our audience, right?

Which is like, some people will be coming to this for the tactics, for the gameplay. And some people will be coming to this for the story. And you, as a player, you should be allowed [01:29:00] to choose why you, you know, what you like about the game. So if you are good at the tactics and you enjoy doing the tactics, you are rewarded with more tactics, with harder battles, with, you know, like more complex mechanics.

If what you like is the story, and you want to go around and talk to people, you are rewarded with more people to talk to an easier combat, right? Like you get abilities and, and upgrades that like, make it easier for you to just get through the fights. And so it's like, you know, the people who liked the story can focus on like getting through the story and reading the story and the people who like the tactics can focus on the tactics and people who want to do everything and do everything.

**Ryan Anderson:** And the, the specifically the theming for the obstacle, I mean, for the upgrades that you would get from story oriented stuff was a, as Kelly mentioned earlier really focused on like those two characters working together in a very obvious way. Like, it would be very much like this makes you better with this specific character and just connected with [01:30:00] yeah, exactly.

And then the challenge, battle upgrades and stuff like that. Those tended to be a bit more just like mechanical and dry and kind of like. Fantasy themes, upgrades and stuff, because like, those were meant for the people who are looking at the rules, texts and getting excited by that. Whereas, you know, the story oriented stuff had little jokes in the flavor text, and a lot of like the beaming was based on the character that you got her from.

So the, the, I guess kind of the place where the two bled into each other was not only did we want to like, kind of reward people with more of what they like about the game, but we also kind of wanted the other half of the game not to get in the way, but kind of make a case for itself, you know, like kind of you know, with the upgrades, you'd get through the side quests and stuff like that kind of entice game, like combat oriented players to engage with the story more rather than just rushing through stuff.

And with a lot of the combat upgrades, you know, kind of entice the story oriented players to enjoy the combos and stuff like that. [01:31:00] Can 

**Kyla Fury:** I, can I tell a short tangential story about the writing? So Ryan, you mentioned the, the flavor text on the. On the, the attacks, I was just thinking like yesterday about the fact that like, man, we wrote those in like the worst possible like Mike and I wrote a lot of the attack flavor stuff, or like finished up a lot of the attack flavor text when we were in an airport on the way to reboot red.

And like, so it was in Canada and our, our, we were going to be landing in Canada at like 1:00 AM and then still had to take like a multi hour, like bus ride to the place we were staying for this conference. And so it was like nine or 10:00 PM. We were sitting in the airport and I had a horrible head cold.

So if some of the jokes in the flavor text for like the attacks, when upgrades seem a little weird, we were a little loopy when we wrote some of that.[01:32:00] 

**Ryan Anderson:** Also, 

**Jonas Rosland:** Some looking through some of the screenshots here. So I really like this this one is kind of shows how again, going back to planning and the way that you can plan your attacks and making sure that you have a lot of fun with the tactics element as well. Utilizing all the, all the different skills that your characters have I've been playing a few other tactics games.

I'm not a tactics gamer. But this one, as I said before, it was easy to understand which I really enjoyed. But again, not easy to master as I am progressing through the story and I realized that there are a lot of nuances here that I don't know about yet. So it's going to be super fun to continue to be progressed through the story here.

So I would like to move on a bit and talk about the reception of the game when it comes to your attendance. So around the world around the [01:33:00] globe conferences and what the reception was there. And then talk a bit about your the reception when the game launched, but let's let's start with conferences.

What did people say? 

**Kyla Fury:** Did we ever go anywhere more global than Canada? I think we mostly just stayed in the us. David 

**Ben Walker:** is the furthest we got, which is still, 

**Jonas Rosland:** you went into 

**Ryan Anderson:** national. Yeah, we 

**Kyla Fury:** were, we were at the reboot bread conference. That was that was held in what is the name of that town? It was at a very fancy hotel.

Fancy bam, bam. Yes. In the town of Banff Canada in the fanciest hotel I have ever been in, in my life. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Very cool. 

**Ben Walker:** Yeah, showing to cons is difficult because especially we were a cozy game and Cousy is a great feeling that everyone wants to feel, but it's not a feeling that is easy to import into a PACS like somewhere where there's, you know, 200 different booths, all vying for your attention [01:34:00] and blaring music and techno is in the background.

So although we actually didn't take it to pecs or very first demo, as I recall, had the characters talking to you, breaking the fourth wall and saying, look, this is a demo. Are you more interested in combat your story? And then we teleported you to like a 15 minutes you know, take of whichever one you selected, which is actually a great idea.

I thought, and a good way to solve that. By the time we did PAX, we realized that if we give people a half hour demo or game was actually sticky enough, they would play for the full half hour. So we gave them both of it. We gave them a little taste of both and they got to play the game for longer. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah.

It's tough to demo narrative games as well in a con setting because like, you know, the, we try and get to the point of the story as quickly as possible, but like, it's still like kind of pushing 30 to maybe 45 minutes, depending on how you play to really get to the point where we've established what's going on.

So I think our original demo was like chat or not our original demo, but like [01:35:00] the demo we ended up doing it. A lot of taxes was like from the beginning of the first chapter. To the moment you meet your first snowball tournament, opponents, and you like talk to the, the young, the young monarchists is the first club.

And that's, that's a chunk of time. And we were lucky that like, most people who played the demo, like wanted to play through the whole thing and would play through to the end, which was like, you know, is a great compliment on the game. But it also means you don't get a ton of throughput at a convention, right.

There aren't that many people who can play because one play through takes a long time. So we were very helped by having like, you know, high screens that people could stand in the back and like watch the gameplay happen. Or I think it didn't like PAX east. You guys went to when you had the vs evil booth, right?

You had a lot more stations than we'd been, are like single computer or two computers or whatever it was that he was single. Yeah. Single computer and TV at, at the indie MEGABOOTH. [01:36:00] 

**Ben Walker:** And we had people sit in beanbags super low to the ground so that people could see what was happening above their heads.

**Ryan Anderson:** Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Very much helped us a lot. That we had like a very visual, like the art style was just incredible for this game. So we had a very visually appealing game. And that, that definitely got a lot of people, very interested, even if they didn't have time to like play. The story to kind of get a feel for like the writer's voice or like our demo, you know, RPGs, you want to slow roll and mechanics and everything.

So like the demo is just teaching you the very basics which doesn't really get into what's actually like special or any nuance or anything. 

**Kyla Fury:** And you have to play the first three chapters of the game to actually have seen all the mechanics in the game, at least once, pretty much not including the like fancy boss fight stuff at the very end, it 

**Ryan Anderson:** turns out pretty games demo very, very well at con even if, even if they're a genre that normally would suffer in that environment.

**Kyla Fury:** All, so we got an unexpected boon [01:37:00] from COVID at the last minute. I think it was because maybe it wasn't because of COVID, but it was because of something, maybe it was just random happenstance, but you guys demoed it PAX east. And we have a publisher there and the publisher was going to show our game on like two screens at their booth because they have like six games that they're showing.

And then like one of the biggest games that was like supposed to come from the UK sort of pulled out at the last minute, like they couldn't make it. So we got all their booth space. So we had to like right before everything or something like that. Yeah. And it was right before everything shut down due to COVID.

So 

**Ben Walker:** that was great. Yeah. We were, you know, part of our publisher. Publishers have a difficult job. And we were part of their release slot and, you know, they released three games a year and we were one of the games that year, who they forgot to show it packs. And the other two games that we're going to release both didn't have the demo ready in time.

They just had production problems. And so the publisher's question became, should we just cancel our entire PAX presence? Or should we give [01:38:00] it all to winter more tactics club? And our response was give it all to us right now. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Kind of the flip side of that coin though, is like, basically like when we launched and when we, when we were on new platforms and everything, every conference was gone and that is, you know, there's so much press that is like very difficult to reach out to so much marketing opportunities.

Like it's, you know, conferences, aren't everything, but it is usually a pretty good space to like, get your finished game in front of the kind of people that would advocate for it. So it was like, yeah, I have a hard time saying we got a boon from the, yeah, 

**Kyla Fury:** no, I, I miss I miss remembered the timeline that just happened randomly because of the other games that we got a big booth, but we did manage to slide in like PAX east was like one of the last big conventions that happened before everything shut down for COVID.

Cause when we were also supposed to do like Emerald city Comicon, I think that year and like a [01:39:00] few other things and like, whoops, by the way, plague. And then it's like, well, you know, we're releasing in may. We're not gonna just like, you know, our team can't really afford to just, you know, back up our release date for a year or more.

So we just released in may and just did it digitally. 

**Ryan Anderson:** So 

**Jonas Rosland:** can you, can you tell me a bit more about how that went? The, the launch and everything. It was in the middle of COVID everyone was trying to get their hands on game consults. The switch was sold out everywhere. And you, you launch a game right in the middle of this.

What, what was the reception 

**Ryan Anderson:** like critically? I remember. 

**Ben Walker:** Yeah, the best thing we had was great, critical reception. There's a funny, I think this game kind of fell into being a common trope of like critically, very well received, but not that many people. When I hear the description of a game that's critically well received, but not many people purchase it.

I think it's something [01:40:00] like that. Dragon cancer, something like, you know, takes on difficult tasks and is very artistic, but a pain in the butt to play, I guess or cart life also did that. And I'm surprised that we fell into that category because I see us as being a very goofy thing that aims at being fun, more than being you know, capitally, artistic.

The fact is 

**Ryan Anderson:** I 

**Kyla Fury:** think the best press we got was from the buried treasure article. That is it, he's the, I was gonna say one of the former writers is that right? Rock paper, shotgun. That's right. Former rock paper, shotgun person. Yeah, runs runs a blog called very treasure where like he just writes up like obscure indie games and gave us like a really glowing up saying like, I would be really surprised if this doesn't catch on because it's like very much in the zeitgeists right now.

It was such a nice, like sweet article and we absolutely didn't catch it on. But we did because of that article, we also made, he was [01:41:00] responsible for compiling a list for Kotaku at the end of the year. That was the top games of 2020 that you've never heard of. And he put us on that list. So. And then also gave us like a little mini press boost and was a really nice thing.

And it's nice to think, like we made somebody's, you know, top games of 2020 lists. We weren't like, 

**Ryan Anderson:** yeah, 

**Kyla Fury:** we did. Yeah, we did get a few, like I think we got like a best tactics RPG from like one online magazine and some or something like that, but that 

**Ryan Anderson:** is pretty good, actually. 

**Ben Walker:** Yeah. It's very difficult to figure out what makes something a commercial success.

Cause I think everyone dreams of releasing the next Minecraft and, you know, being able to throw $10 million towards your next game when your, when your first game was an Indy labor of love. And it is very, very difficult when looking at a game that is not yet released to identify whether or not it will be a commercial sector.

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. And it's, you know, it's tough because I feel like most people who play our [01:42:00] game really enjoy the game and are sort of many, are sort of surprised at how much they enjoy the game based on the feedback we get. But it just, it didn't spread enough. You know, we just didn't have enough reach to, to get heard of exactly.

That looks like septicemia there. That would imply you're pretty far in the 

**Jonas Rosland:** that is correct. That is correct. Yeah, it's it I've been having a blast playing 

**Ryan Anderson:** this. 

**Kyla Fury:** And so, you know, I think. Obviously, we, we wish it had sold really well and made us a lot of money and funded our, our next game. But I am, I'm glad that people like for, for me personally, who like has another job and doesn't have to have a financial stake in like this, this determines whether I eat or not.

I'm more proud to have made a game. I'm happy to have made a game I'm proud of, right. That I feel like said something and meant something. And I feel like we, we made a good game and I feel good about the thing we [01:43:00] released into the world. Like, to me, that's much more important and I guess that's, you know, that's the indie life, right?

Is that's the thing that you prioritize that instead of bubble shooters and you, 

**Ryan Anderson:** Hey, now I made good Snoopy pop was a work of art. 

**Kyla Fury:** As you pointed out, public shooters don't make money either. So 

**Ryan Anderson:** yeah, they don't make any money compared to the slot machines or match threes and everything, which is why I kept losing my job.

But the voice of booklet, I 

**Jonas Rosland:** think they your, your statement there, Kyla the the passion statement ties back to what Ben kind of started this interview with as well. Going from a AAA studio to doing something that you really, really wanted to do. And. Yeah, 

**Kyla Fury:** God bless Ben who basically bankrolled this whole project project.

I just want to say, like, we did get a publisher towards the end who got us money for like marketing and things like that. But none of this would've would have happened if Ben [01:44:00] hadn't been like, you know, I want to invest in doing a passion project with some friends and like that's an amazing thing.

Amazing and scary thing to do. And so, you know, respect. 

**Jonas Rosland:** So all was scary. I bet. I bet. So on that note, where do you where do you all see the indie scene going within the next couple of years? What, what are you most excited about in what kind of, what kind of games do you envision we'll 

**Ryan Anderson:** have here in a couple of years, 

**Ben Walker:** I can say I've been thrilled by the story of Val Haim.

And I assume, you know, he'd been playing behind, it's got like 5 million players right now that it was, I want to say six French non-professional devs who made it, that I'm in love, this idea of with early access and with sort of Twitch democratizing the idea of game marketing a little bit. [01:45:00] You see more games being made that target exactly what gamers want to do.

I think that's super healthy and it's because like, it is easier to make indie games now, and it's easier to make people aware of any games, but kind of a dark flip side of the coin is so many indie games come out that the signal to noise ratio is absolutely insane. And many people 

**Ryan Anderson:** really make very good stuff, but nobody hears about yep.

Yep, yep, yep. Yep. Anyhow, 

**Ben Walker:** it's two sides of the same coin and I don't know, it's just the change and it's hard to call it either exclusively good or exclusively bad, but more people make games. Now 

**Kyla Fury:** I, I foresee and this is maybe not exactly the future of the indie scene specifically, but I foresee a big expansion in the AA genre, because I think we're starting to see, and this is a thing that my husband and I talk about and argue about all the time, but it seems like we're starting to see some cracks in the foundation at the AAA level where the, [01:46:00] the amount of money needed to make the, the big AAA monsters is just not like you can't make that back no matter how good your sales are and you end up like having to rush it anyway.

And you end up with like weird buggy messages that people hate you for releasing regardless. Right. So I think hopefully if they learn anything from. Big failures. We're going to see a lot of the really big companies investing in a lot of smaller projects rather than like two or three giant big tent poles, just because it's safer.

And hopefully that's, hopefully that's good for the industry. Like, I don't know if that's a good thing or 

**Ryan Anderson:** it's going to be P S two era all over again. Hell yes. Someone who really liked that era and thought that there was a lot of like very creative stuff coming out of PlayStation one, PlayStation, two kind of seen, especially from a lot of those, like mid-sized studios or small teams with a big bank role from like a publisher or something [01:47:00] like 

**Kyla Fury:** instead of spending $300 million on a game, you could make 30 $10 million games.

Right. Right. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Val Haim is a great game to mention in this kind of like being very economical and smart about how you approach it because the game scales insanely well, that game could have sold very, very poorly. And it would just be what it is, and it wouldn't need anything more, but because it's sold super well.

You know, the game servers are decentralized. There's a lot of stuff that like, they don't have like the issue that most MMOs have when they blow up, which is suddenly like, oh God, we have to support 10 times. The number of people we were expecting on like our actual infrastructure that we own and have to manage.

And we're spending all that time dealing with those fires instead of the game of Val I'm, you know, like the players are handling the server on their own end and everything. And like, while there's definitely, probably like a lot of scaling issues, they still have to deal with it's. They were very [01:48:00] smart about like where they put their focus and very efficient with things, you know, or the whole game is proc gen it's like one gig because it's all like lighting shader effects, but very cheap models and very few of them 

**Kyla Fury:** I'm honestly kind of surprised and impressed at how well the early access model has been doing like Val Haim.

And Haiti's both like, you know, really blow up before they're done done, not that a game is ever done, but because there's so many drawbacks to doing early access and there's so much antipathy towards game marketing, where especially for like unfinished products that it's surprising to me, how many indie hits come out of early access stuff.

**Ryan Anderson:** And. 

**Ben Walker:** Early access gives you a chance to like really focus on what the gamers like. Cause I think early access games that don't have a discord and actually listen to what their discord users post and like, you know, give weekly updates and be like these come from the community. I think those early access games fail.

And [01:49:00] 

**Ryan Anderson:** yeah, the way 

**Ben Walker:** to use early access is to really like, you know, iterate on finding the thing that your players love and also turning them into people who will proselytize your game because they feel like they got to play game designer a little bit. Their suggestions made it in. I don't know. That definitely is a way that seems to be getting more popular to successfully make your game.

Absolutely monster huge. 

**Ryan Anderson:** And honestly, I love the kind of like transparency with the process. I feel there's so many misunderstandings even today with like what game development is or what each job does and stuff like that. That like, I love seeing so much more of game developers engaging with players and players approaching game developers with curiosity, as opposed to like entitlement and stuff like that, you know, like they actually want to know about the process and honestly, because a lot of them want to do it themselves.

And I think that's, that's very cool. Like as far as like the indie scene goes I mean I'm still working on indie games, so I hope it's going to be okay by the [01:50:00] time I stretch. But the I'm also very excited for like there, I feel there's a lot of very good talent that has been coming up, especially out of modding spaces and hobbies.

That had access to a lot of tools and engines and everything along those, and like resources online that like many developers who are professionals now did not have when they're growing up. So I can definitely see there being, I don't know about like everybody, you know, being successful or anything, but I could see an explosion of extremely high quality work and extremely interesting games coming out over the next decade.

Just as a lot more of those, like already, I'm starting to see a lot of like the younger Indies that we were showing with just coming up with some very interesting stuff that does give me a lot of those like PlayStation era vibes that 

**Kyla Fury:** I, and when people do weird experimental stuff, because they can like, that's my favorite thing about indie games is that it doesn't have to be bubble shooters or inhalers.

Right. Is it, [01:51:00] people are like, I had this weird idea that I really wanted to try it and see if it works. And I hope that like people who do take risks, like continue to be able to find a place to thrive because that's not an easy 

**Ryan Anderson:** and along those lines definitely random shout out to the Calico team who they think they showed a, any MEGABOOTH of us a couple of times.

As like that, that team definitely seems like people to watch. As far as like examples of like just very like talented people that are bringing a lot of like, really interesting ideas to like. Games even are, or should be to the table as just like very emergent kind of playground aspect to it.

And it's really great. Seeing players actually engage with a lot more games, kind of like Val Haim and everything that invite you to create a fun space to play yourself within their world. And like the world is conducive to certain things. But ultimately it's like players being [01:52:00] very self-directed and curious about games, which I think as creatives gives us a lot more space to work, you know, so we don't have to make something that directly appeals to what they're already expecting and because yeah, in addition to there being more creative Debs entering the scene, I think there's going to be more creative players.

And I think that's a very, very good 

**Kyla Fury:** thing to say, to say nothing of our other writers, other game that he's working on right now, which is called astronaut the best, which is a very like weird experimental game, which I hope everybody checks out when it when it's ready. Astro like space program simulator with just the worst astronauts.

It's a pretty, it's a pretty wacky game. If you like the humor in winter more, you, you should check out astronauts the best when it's ready. 

**Ryan Anderson:** I'll definitely check that out 

**Ben Walker:** as the website. 

**Kyla Fury:** Yes, too. Dumb dot for space or to dumb 

**Ryan Anderson:** for 

**Ben Walker:** that space. Yeah. Yeah. Got that mirror dots face coming 

**Ryan Anderson:** name. 

**Jonas Rosland:** So [01:53:00] with that we're going to wrap up the interview.

I want to thank you all for a fantastic time here. Talking about winter more tactics club, where can people find you online if they want to reach out to you? Ben. 

**Ben Walker:** Oh yeah. So you can find us online@wintermoretc.com or if you just want to get our delectable hot takes on Twitter, you can find me at Walker B w a L K E R B.

**Kyla Fury:** Yeah. And I'm my personal Twitter is at Kyla underscore go. So K Y a K Y L a underscore go. And I also do a bi-weekly podcast with some friends. I know everybody does a podcast, but we do like a, a book club style thing for games called feedback force. So if you want to look up feedback force on SoundCloud, we play a lot of like you know, weird indie games among other things.

And you know, we, we analyze the game design in them and that's a fun time. So[01:54:00] we're, we're thinking of doing bowel. We haven't done Val Haim yet. We're doing loop hero right now because Lupe heroes, the other is like ice game. Lou PIRO is quite good. Yes. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Yeah. And you can find me on Twitter at R Y E a N D E R at right-hander. And then, yeah I also do a podcast. It is pretentious game ideas.

I think our most recent episode is actually the winner more one. So that that's more of a deep dive on like specific combat things, but yeah, and that one's a lot more just me interviewing random people from the industry with some of my friends and talking about different games and specifically like a mechanic or like a major trope in a lot of games and kind of like elaborating it where it's used well, where it's used badly, like the kind of impact it has.

So it's men is like, if you're a game design student or something, like, I think most of our audiences, a game design college students. So but yeah, that's, that's what [01:55:00] you're interested in. It's we, we talked to some people who are much better game designers than I am, so you can, you can pick their brains vicariously through me.

**Kyla Fury:** Did you say what the name of the podcast is? Yes. 

**Ryan Anderson:** Pretentious game ideas. Oh, that's the name? Oh, no. Yeah. I mean, I do a lot of potentials game ideas, but no, it is actually, yeah, it's, it's an inside joke as most podcasts are. I love it. I 

**Jonas Rosland:** love it. And yeah, I'm Jonas rosland@jonasroslynonthetwitterandofcoursehitsave.org and hit save org is our Twitter.

Thank you. Ben, Kayla and Ryan for a fantastic time. Talking about winter more tactics club. That's been super, super fun until next time. Have 

**Ryan Anderson:** a good[01:56:00] .
